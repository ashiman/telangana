With the revision of cost norms, food models were  revised in consultation with stakeholders to provide for calories / protein/RDA  as per GOI norms and to ensure that the Supplementary food is acceptable to the  target groups.
In brief, the supplementary nutrition provided for  the various categories of target groups is as follows:
Pregnant & Lactating women get
“one  full meal”
Arogyalaksmi
3 to 6 years children as part of Pre-school get a  hot meal of rice, dal, vegetables,egg, and Nutri snacks/chana dal/daily.  Malnourished children i.e SUW/SAM/MAM children between 7 months to 3 years are  given additional supplementation of 1 egg, 100 ml milk, mini meal+ extra oil  daily at the Anganwadi centre.
Malnourished children i.e SUW/SAM/MAM between 3 to  6 years are given additional supplementation of 1 egg, 100 ml milk, oil ( with  hot meal), 50 gms of Balamrutham daily at the Anganwadi centre.
Feeds for Malnourished children of age groups 7  months to 3 years and 3 to 6 years, are supervised and certain feeds are given  at the AWC itself. Hence the additional supplementation are made part of model  menus which are appropriate for the malnourished children. Detailed guidelines  issued for the “Special care and Supervised feeding” of malnourished children  upto 5 years include methodology of identification and categorization of  children as Severely Underweight (SUW)/ Severe Acute Malnutrition(SAM)/  Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and the details of the Model Menus.

Special care and Supervised feeding

Although ICDS provides for “double ration” for  malnourished children under 5 years, this has neither yielded the desired  results nor enabled to have adequate followup of the malnourished children.  Therefore guidelines have been issued for identifying malnourished children  upto 5 years by “weight for age” criteria, by    “weight for height” criteria and by presentation of “bilateral pitting  oedema” and to take “Special care and Supervised feeding” of such children.
Children upto 5 years will be  identified as Severely Underweight (SUW) as per the “weight for age” criteria  and will be identified as Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)/Moderate Acute  Malnutrition (MAM) as per the “weight for height” criteria. However children  below 6 months who are SUW are automatically SAM and their height need not be  measured. Also all children upto 5 years who have nutritional oedema (bilateral  pitting oedema) are SAM and their weight and height need not be recorded.
For such identification, Anganwadi  workers (AWWs) will record weight of children once in a month and will measure  their height once in 3 months. Based on the “weight for age” criteria, the AWW  will plot the weight for each child in the growth monitoring register and will  categorize the child as Severely Underweight (SUW)/ Moderately Underweight  (MUW) / Normal, if the graph for the child is in red zone, yellow zone or green  zone respectively. Based on “weight for height” criteria, the AWW will use the  “Reference Card” and if for a particular height the weight of the child  is low/too low, the child is categorized under MAM/SAM.
All children upto 6 months categorized as SUW  (automatically SAM too) will be examined by Medical Officer (PHC) [MO(PHC)] and  will compulsorily be referred to the Nutrition Rehabilitation Centre  (NRC).  In the meanwhile, the mother of  such a child will be encouraged to continue exclusive breastfeeding.
All children upto 5 years who have nutritional  oedema (bilateral pitting oedema) (automatically SAM too) will be examined by  MO(PHC) and will compulsorily be referred to the NRC. In the meanwhile,  supervised feeding will be provided for the child as explained hereunder.
All children identified as SUW/ SAM/ MAM upto 5  years will be given “Special care and Supervised feeding”. For this purpose  model menus have been separately prescribed for the age groups of 7 months - 3  years and 3-6 years at Table 1 and Table 2 below. As per these menus, SUW/ SAM/ MAM  children will be given caloric dense food every 2 hours. Among these feeds,  certain feeds (viz of egg, milk and meal + oil) will be given to “7 months – 3  years” and certain feeds (viz of egg, milk, meal +oil, snack, balamrutham) will  be given to “3-6 years” at the AWC itself. The AWW will however supervise not  only these feeds at the AWC but also the feeds to be given at home.

Balamrutham - Weaning food for children between 7months and 3 years

“Balamrutham”
The recommended quantity is  100 gms which is to be given to children 3-5 times every day. For children  below one year, Balamrutham can be served as porridge mixed with hot water and  for older children, it can be given in the form of “Laddu”.
Balamrutham  is distributed in packets of 2.5 Kg per child per month. It is distributed on  first day of every month on Nutrition Health Day-1 to mothers of 7 months - 3  years children as Take Home Ration. Along with Balamrutham packet, these  children also receive 2 eggs a week at the AWC under ICDS Food Model for  7months to 3 years under ICDS is at Table-III.
It is expected that  Balamrutham will serve as an effective supplementary nutrition during the  child’s crucial period of 7 months to 3 years and along with counseling to mother  on IYCF practices will help to prevent incidence of chronic malnutrition.
Balamrutham  serves not only as a weaning food but also as a caloric dense food to reduce  malnutrition and is therefore used as part of Supervised feeding for  malnourished children.
