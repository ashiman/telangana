"Empowering women is not only a moral responsibility but also need of the hour. WE HUB has a vision to empower rural and urban women and induce the necessary skillsets for them to become independent. I believe the state’s mission of “Bangaru Telangana” will come true once every women is empowered in the state."

FAQ's
Women First, Prosperity for All
Q. How can I apply for WE HUB Incubation?
A. Please click on Application for Incubation at the top-right corner of this page. You can fill out the simple 2-page application form and we will get back to you within 3 weeks of the close of application deadline. If you meet our requirements and guidelines, you will be given an opportunity to present about your startup on pitch-day to a diverse committee which takes the final decision on admission.
Q. I have already applied for Incubation on this website, but I haven’t heard back from anyone yet. How can I find out the status of my application?
A. We take additional care to ensure that every application is scrutinized and the information on the decision taken is updated to the applicant at the earliest. Typically, you can expect a reply from us 3 weeks from the deadline. If you have not heard back from us after a month of the deadline, please reach out to wehub-info@telangana.gov.in
Q. What are services are offered as part of the incubation?
Please refer to
Support
Q. I would love to be incubated at WE HUB. However, I already have another facility where our product is manufactured. Can I still be incubated at WE HUB without being physically present there?
A. In this case, you may opt for Virtual Incubation. Virtual Incubation is the same as Physical Incubation minus dedicated space at WE HUB's facility. Virtual Incubation can be applied for by entrepreneurs who cannot relocate their workplace to WE HUB's facility due to travel or work related constraints. For example, if you are an entrepreneur who sells customized products which require a manufacturing unit (ex. Food and beverage, Hardware manufacturing etc.) you might have to locate yourself at the manufacturing facility and cannot be working out of WE HUB on a daily basis. In such a case, you can opt for Virtual Incubation through which you will be able to benefit from all other incubation services offered by WE HUB.
Q. What support does WE HUB offer for women entrepreneurs running small businesses?
Q. Is WE HUB for women only?
A. No. Although WE HUB’s goal is to enable women entrepreneurs succeed in their journey, it is not exclusively for women only. Most of the activities we undertake, events/workshops we conduct will be focused on women entrepreneurs and alleviating the barriers they face. However, for availing incubation services, you need not have an all women team. Majority of the co-founders should be women and they should be playing a pivotal role in driving the enterprise. In order to ensure this, we allow only women co-founders to present on the company’s behalf on pitch day.
Q. I am not a WE HUB Incubatee. Can I still attend events/workshops organized by WE HUB?
A. Yes. WE HUB is a platform whose goal is to enable women entrepreneurs succeed, irrespective of whether they are incubated at WE HUB or not. Please feel free to attend all our events/workshops and stay connected to the eco-system.

About Us
Women First, Prosperity for All
The primary objective of WE HUB is to enable women entrepreneurs to succeed in their start-ups or businesses by overcoming structural challenges. Through our primary activity, we plan to create an eco-system that drives social change across India and the world. WE HUB is envisioned to create a supportive community for aspiring women entrepreneurs where they can interact with VCs for funding, connect with corporates for scaling up their business, get advice from mentors to fine tune ideas, avoid costly mistakes, and march forward on the path to success with renewed confidence.
WE HUB is the first-of-its-kind and only State-run platform for Women Entrepreneurs. We help women from diverse backgrounds by providing a soft-landing hub and mentoring them to be successful in their entrepreneurial journey.
Women today face a lot of societal barriers when it comes to starting their own businesses. Some of them being lack of capital support, professional network, business knowledge & expertise, work- life balance. At WE HUB, we provide 360-degree support for any aspiring women entrepreneur. Services we provide include seed funding, mentoring, virtual programs (in case women can’t travel), business guidance, Government liaison which will help women establish their own enterprise.
Being a state led initiative, we offer our services at reasonable costs and in some cases no cost at all. Since empowering women and building women entrepreneurs is our priority, the state has offered exciting benefits for companies who want to be a part of this journey and partner with us.
