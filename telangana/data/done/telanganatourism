Heritage in Karimnagar
Elgandal Fort
The spires of the Elgandal Fort or Elagandula Khilla stand tall into the sky, piercing their way out to narrate the stories of its glorious past from the skyline of Karimnagar. They stand proudly narrating the glories of its past to posterity. Even after facing ravages of man and nature, the Elgandal fort still stands high showing its lust for power that has been pivotal in grazing and raising dynasties. The crumbling walls of this magnificent fort still carry the stamp of every dynasty that had once embraced its illustrious portals. Despite its debauched state, the Fort still remains one of the most splendid relics of Telangana's history and a commonly visited spot in Karimnagar tourism.
Located on a very scenic hillock, the fort gives a beautiful view of the Elgandal town. The fort is accessed with its only entrance gateway. The sumptuousness of the entrance gate continues to appeal tourists even today. The Elgandal town is situated on the banks of the Manair River. This place has become an important part of history as it has seen the reign of five major dynasties – the Kakatiyas, the Bahmanis, the Qutub Shahis, the Mughals and the Nizams.

Heritage in Medak
Medak Fort
The Medak Fort is a huge structure that takes nestling on the top of a hill. It hardly takes about 10 minutes from the town if you take the newly laid CC road. About one-and-a-half hour drive from Hyderabad will take you to your destination.
If you wish to get to the top of this beautiful fort, you need to boost up your energy as a stretch of more than 500 steps await you. This enormous fort was built about 800 years back in Medak, which was then the headquarters of the district. The fort demands one's attention with its typical construction. It is elevated at about 90 metres height from the ground level and is spread in about 100 acres on the hilly region. It is believed that the Medak Fort which was built by the great Kakatiya's was renovated by the royal Qutub Shahis's some 400 years ago. On both left and right sides on the top of the third gate, stands out the 'Ganda Bherunda,' the emblem of Vijayanagara Empire built by the great ruler Srikrishna Devaraya. The historic fort, which was graced by two great dynasties — Kakatiya's and Qutub Shahi's is one of the main attractions of Medak. This 12th century piece of excellence has its own testimony attributing to the Kakatiyan glory during its golden reign. The fort houses a small lake, a barrack and a warehouse.

Heritage in Hyderabad
Golconda Fort
Golconda Fort is located in the western part of Hyderabad city and is about 9 km from the Hussain Sagar Lake. The outer fort occupies an area of three square kilometers, which is 4.8 kilometers in length.
It was originally known as Mankal, and built on a hilltop in the year 1143. It was originally a mud fort under the reign of Rajah of Warangal. Later it was fortified between 14th and 17th centuries by the Bahmani Sultans and then the ruling Qutub Shahi dynasty. Golconda was the principal capital of the Qutub Shahi kings. The inner fort contains ruins of palaces, mosques and a hill top pavilion, which rises about 130 meters high and gives a bird’s eye view of other buildings.
Golconda fort is undoubtedly one of most magnificent fortress complexes in India. The history of Golconda Fort goes back to early 13th century, when it was ruled by the Kakatiya’s followed by Qutub Shahi kings, who ruled the region in 16th and 17th century. The fortress rests on a granite hill 120 meters high while huge crenellated ramparts surround this structure.
It was initially called Shepherd’s Hill, meaning Golla Konda in Telugu while according to legend, on this rocky hill a shepherd boy had come across an idol and the information was conveyed to the ruling Kakatiya king at that time. The king constructed a mud fort around this holy spot and after 200 years, Bahamani rulers took possession of the place. Later the Qutub Shahi kings converted this into massive granite fort extending 5km in circumference. The fort is considered a mute witness to historic events. The Qutub Shahis reign at Golconda ended in 1687 when it was run over by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who intentionally left it in ruins
Golconda still boasts of mounted cannons, four drawbridges, eight gateways, and majestic halls, magazines, stables etc. The outermost enclosure is called Fateh Darwaza meaning Victory gate, after Aurangzeb’s army marched successfully through this gate. At Fateh Darwaza one can witness fantastic acoustical effects, which is one among the many famous engineering marvels at Golconda. Clapping your hand at a certain point near the dome entrance reverberates which is heard clearly at the hill top pavilion, almost one kilometer away. This served as a warning note to the inhabitants of the fort of any impending danger, Ofcourse it now amuses visitors. The fort gains an impressive place among the architectural marvels and heritage structures of India and is a testimony to Hyderabad’s glorious past.

Charminar is a monument and a mosque, which is synonymous with the history of Hyderabad, India. The majestic structure was completed in 1591 CE and is not only a landmark building of Hyderabad but also a famous monument of India. It is believed that Mohammed Quli Qutb Shahi, the fifth sultan of the Qutub Shahi dynasty had built the monument to commemorate the end of a deadly plague menace that had gripped the city then. It is located near the bank of the river Musi. Charminar is derived from two distinct words Char and Minar, which means four towers. Mir Momin Astarabadi of Qutb Shah dynasty played an important role and he ordered extensive preparations for the design and layout. Historians believe that this structure is an example for Indo-Islamic architecture combined with few Persian elements. The monument is located in the heart of old city and it is believed that Hyderabad was measured in four directions from Charminar for administrative purposes.
A visit to Hyderabad is incomplete without visiting this grand and majestic centerpiece. It is also considered the Arc de Triomphe of the East. Some of the historians say that it was built it in honor of his wife, Bhagyamathi. There is also legend that tells about the existence of a secret tunnel underneath the monument connecting the fort at Golconda that was created as a means of escape to royal family in an emergency. Each of the sides measure 20 meters while the minarets are located at a height of 48.7 meters from the ground level. Each side of Charminar opens into a plaza like structure where the giant arches overlook the major thoroughfares. It is a clear square structure that measures 31.95 mts. on each side while imposing arches span a distance of 11mts. The four minarets rise to a height of 56 mts. The ornamental arches on the minarets enhance the aesthetic value. There are 149 circular steps inside each minaret and one of them is open for tourists to climb and enjoy a breathtaking view of the city. It also houses the oldest mosque in Hyderabad with prayer spaces for the devout to worship.
Islamic architecture of those times is marked by arches, minarets, and domes. The structure is famous for its profuse stucco decorations and arrangement of impressive balustrades and balconies. The floral design is executed delicately and stands as a masterpiece to the combination of Mughal and Hindu architecture crafted by the local artisans. The four clocks in four cardinal directions were added in the year 1889. The base of Charminar has a water cistern located at center which consists of a small fountain for ablutions, before the faithful offer prayers in the mosque. Charminar has become synonymous with the culture of old city of Hyderabad and the area is also a popular destination for lip smacking Muslim dishes, colorful bangles, pearls, jewellry and other items. The place is a symbol of Hyderabadi culture and stands tall and proud as a reminder of the glorious era.

Divine in Warangal
Ramappa Temple
Warangal in the Deccan plateau is home to the very classic and brilliant Kakatiya art. The Ramalingeswara Temple which is popularly known as the Ramappa temple is one such amazing piece of art that stands as a testimony of the royal Kakatiyas. The temple got its name Ramappa because of its chief sculptor Ramappa. It's probably the only temple in the country to be known by the name of its sculptor. The medieval Deccan Ramappa Temple which dates back to 1213 AD, was built by the patronage of the Kakatiya ruler Kakati Ganapathi Deva under the authority of his Chief Commander Rudra Samani at the place known as Ranakude in the Atukuru province. The Ramappa temple is the right destination for people who admire architectural brilliance and have a panoramic view of true scenic beauty. The temple is situated in Palampet village of the Venkatapur Mandal, in Mulug Taluq of Warangal.
The Ramappa temple has been referred as the brightest star in the network of medieval temples in the Deccan region. You can reach the temple via a royal garden, which is now reduced to a lawn with a path paved by trees. Another striking feature of this temple is that it is built with bricks that are so light that they can easily float on water. The temple which is situated in a valley took nearly 40 years to be completed. Elaborate carvings line the walls and also cover the pillars and ceilings of the temple.
The Ramappa temple finds its hold on a 6 feet high platform on a cruciform plan. The temple's chamber is crowned with a shikharam and is surrounded by pradakshinapatha. At the entrance of the temple, we can find a Nandi mandapam. An imposing Nandi vigraham stands on it.

Jagannath Temple
Shri Jagannath means the lord of the universe, the supreme solace and a savior for countless devotees across the globe. Since times immemorial, the powerful god’s magnificent and monumental shrine in Orissa draws lakhs of devotees. Jagannath Temple is dedicated to revered God Shri Krishna. Jagan means Universe and Nath is the Lord. He is one of the incarnations of Vishnu.
This temple is a replica of the original Jagannath Temple of Puri. However, this temple is much smaller and its design resembles the one in Puri, Orissa. The Hyderabad version of Puri’s temple was built on 3000-square yard area. It is located adjacent to the Telangana Bhavan in the posh suburbs of Banjara Hills. This temple is so captivating that it is tagged as one of the must-visit places of Hyderabad. The most appealing portion of the temple is its “Shikaram” (the peak or the top). It is about 70 feet in height. Sand stones brought from Orissa have been used in the construction of this temple, and that justifies its red colour and around 60 sculptors were employed to carve this awe-inspiring temple.
The main idols of the temple are Lord Krishna along with his brother BalaRama and sister Subhadra. It also houses five small temples in the premises, that are dedicated to Lord Ganesh (which is to the left of main entrance), Lord Shiva (in the front), Goddess Bhimala ( to the the left on back side), Goddess Lakshmi ( to the right) and two shrines for Navagraha and Shri Hanuman. The temple has three entrances while the main entrance opens right in front of the main temple. One cannot miss noticing the intricately done exterior carving which is considered iconic. The exteriors of the temple are completely made of sand stone while the sanctum sanctorum is done in plain brick wall from the inside. It is considered as one of the modern architectural marvels of Hyderabad city and draws hundreds of visitors every day. It is a place where the city’s Oriya community bond together.

Alampur Jogulamba Temple
Alampur is a sleepy town situated on the banks Tungabhadra River, in the state of Telangana. Alampur is considered as the western gateway of Srisailam. Here the marvelous temple and remains of some ancient temple signify Badami Chalukyan architecture. The region was ruled by many South Indian dynasties. The principal deities at the Jogulamba temple are Jogulamba and Balabrahmeshwara. Goddess Jogulamba is considered the 5th Shakti Peeta among 18 shakti peetams in the country. Here Goddess Jogulamba is seen seated on the Corpse with scorpion, frog, and lizard on the head. She is seen in a naked avtar with her tongue stretched outside, an avtar of fierce goddess that grants Siddhi in Yoga and hence called Jogulamba. This word is a changed form of Yogula Amma in Telugu which means Mother of Yogis.
According to a popular legend there was a great saint in 6th century called Rasa Siddha who had the power to convert base metal into gold and he was considered close to chalukya king Pulakesi II, instrumental in constructing any temples called ‘Nava Brahmas’. According to the legend, the nine names of Siva are actually the names of medicinal herbs put forth by Rasa Siddha and there are nine temples here. They are the Swarga Brahma Temple Padma Brahma Temple, Vishva Brahma Temple Arka Brahma Temple, Bala Brahma Temple, Garuda Brahma Temple, and Taraka Brahma Temple. The Siddha Rasarnavam is a tantric work, which states that if upasana is performed as per the prescribed Tantra, then Mercury oozes from the Linga of Bala Brahma, Thighs of Subramanya, Navel of Ganapati, and Mouth of Mother Jogulamba, which can be converted into Gold by using the medicinal herbs.
The popular temple stands as a testimony to Chalukya Art and Culture. The Tungabhadra and Krishna are seen in a confluence near Alampur, and hence it is also known as Dakshina Kailasam. It is also said that Brahma had performed a great penance at today’s Alampur for thousands of years, and he pleased Lord Siva who conferred the powers of creation for him. Hence, the deity is also called Brahmeswara and the goddess as Yogini or Jogulamba, a synonym for mother Parvathi.

Nature in Warangal
Laknavaram
Lakhnavaram Lake, located in Govindaraopet Mandal about 70 kilometers away from Warangal, is a trending picnic spot. The lake is an exceptional thing of beauty. The lake was formed by closing down three narrow valleys. Each valley is replaced with a short bund, and hills act as their natural barrier. The lake has been constructed by the rulers of the Kakatiya dynasty in 13th Century A.D. An added advantage is that the lake takes shelter in isolated surroundings and this makes your holiday very private.
The entire region seems bountiful with green crops and pleasant water resources. The Lakhnavaram Lake which hides itself amidst the hills was discovered during the Kakatiya reign and the rulers expanded it to grow as a source of irrigation. An added attraction to this mystic beauty is the suspension bridge. The hanging bridge takes you to the mini island in the lake. The authorities maintaining the lake also provide boat riding facility which will take you close to the most serene part of the lake.

Chowmahalla Palace
The history of Hyderabad is so enticing that it feels like reading a wonderful love story and its glorious past is no less than a fairy tale. And the most interesting part of this novel forms the rule of the Nizams, which fills pages of history with legendary contributions of art, architecture and science.
A testimony to this aspect is seen in the form of the many exquisite monuments scattered all over the city. One such monument that in its striking sumptuousness still shows off the power of time immemorial is the engrossing Chowmahalla Palace. The name Chowmahalla refers to four palaces. The construction of the palace was initiated in the year 1750 by Nizam Salabhat Jung but it was Nizam Afzar-ud-Dawla Bahadur who saw that the palace was completed between the years 1857 and 1869. Originally, the palace covered 45 acres from Laad Bazaar on the north to Aspan Chowk Road which is on the south. The Chowmohalla complex is a replica of Shah’s Palace in Teheran, Iran. Presently the palace consists of two courtyards with graceful palaces, the grand Durbar Hall or the Khilwat. Gardens and fountains add to the elegance
Southern Courtyard is the oldest part of the complex. It comprises of four graceful palaces Tahniyat Mahal, Mahtab Mahal, Afzal Mahal, and Aftab Mahal. Northern Courtyard has been restored and is open to the public. The main attraction of this area is the Bara Imam, which is a long corridor. It has rooms on the east wing, which once served as the administrative wing. Another stunning construction is the Clock Tower. It houses the Khilwat Clock which still works perfectly.

Paigah Tombs
The noble families of Paigah, during the 18th century were among the most influential and powerful families of the Princely State of Hyderabad’s aristocracy. Claiming to be the descendents of the Hazrath Omar bin Al-Khattab, Islam’s second caliph, the nobles of Paigah were believed to be wealthier than the average Maharajah of the country and they were the only ones to have the privilege maintaining their own court, palaces, as well as their own private armies, which often numbered several thousands. Paigah is a Farsi world, which says “footstool”. It means Right-hand man in English.
Abdul Fateh Khan Tegh Jung is credited as the founder of the Paigah nobility. He founded the nobility when he served for the second Nizam, Salabat Jang. Sahams-ul-Mulk, Shams-ul-Doula, and Shams-ul-Umara, were the hereditary titles conferred to him by the Nizam. It means “the sun among the masses and nobles”. The Paigahs were given the responsibility to take care of the security and defense of the state. The Paigahs were very close to the Nizams.
The Paigahs, who were the great patrons of tarts have extended their unmatched grace and elegance even to their exquisite tombs. The Paigah Tombs that grace the city among the many wonders that fill the pages of the most promising history. The marvelous artistry of the Paigahs is shown in the mosaic tile work that has been inlaid. The Paigah tombs, located at the Pisal Banda suburbs in Hyderabad, are most intricately carved and are enclosed in facades of pierced marble. The tombs are the finest examples of the enthralling Indo-Islamic architecture, which is a blend of both features of Asaf Jahi and Rajputani style.

Ramappa Temple
Warangal in the Deccan plateau is home to the very classic and brilliant Kakatiya art. The Ramalingeswara Temple which is popularly known as the Ramappa temple is one such amazing piece of art that stands as a testimony of the royal Kakatiyas. The temple got its name Ramappa because of its chief sculptor Ramappa. It's probably the only temple in the country to be known by the name of its sculptor. The medieval Deccan Ramappa Temple which dates back to 1213 AD, was built by the patronage of the Kakatiya ruler Kakati Ganapathi Deva under the authority of his Chief Commander Rudra Samani at the place known as Ranakude in the Atukuru province. The Ramappa temple is the right destination for people who admire architectural brilliance and have a panoramic view of true scenic beauty. The temple is situated in Palampet village of the Venkatapur Mandal, in Mulug Taluq of Warangal.
The Ramappa temple has been referred as the brightest star in the network of medieval temples in the Deccan region. You can reach the temple via a royal garden, which is now reduced to a lawn with a path paved by trees. Another striking feature of this temple is that it is built with bricks that are so light that they can easily float on water. The temple which is situated in a valley took nearly 40 years to be completed. Elaborate carvings line the walls and also cover the pillars and ceilings of the temple.
The Ramappa temple finds its hold on a 6 feet high platform on a cruciform plan. The temple's chamber is crowned with a shikharam and is surrounded by pradakshinapatha. At the entrance of the temple, we can find a Nandi mandapam. An imposing Nandi vigraham stands on it.

Dhulikatta
The Buddhist circuit has a lot of prominent places that spell their glory. One such prominent places of the Buddhists takes nestling in Telangana, in the Karimnagar in a small town called Dhulikatta. The village is only 25 kilometers away from the Karimnagar city. The Buddhist Mahastupa or the great stupa and vihar in Dhulikatta village were established at the end of the 2nd century BC, which is more than 2000 years ago. During that period, the region played a greater role and thus was protected with numerous fortifications. According to many historians, the description of this fortified town which is situated on the banks of a river that has been conceptualized by the Greek emissary Megasthenes, matches with that of this town. The remains and ruins of this ancient stupa that has been built on an elevated place are still discernible. The constructions of platforms make the Mahastupa look larger. The lime-stone blocks that are elegantly carved are decorated with many Buddhist symbols like the Muchalindanaga (a snake from the Buddhist mythology). Several other remnants such as the punched coins from Roman Kingdom and Satvahana dynasty, beads, combs made of ivory, bangles and authentic silver jewellery have been brought to light in the excavations around the Mahastupa in Dhulikatta.

Karimnagar Silver Filigree Craft
Filigree is a delicate kind of work that is done on metals. Gold and silver are used in shaping up beautiful works of art. The Karimnagar city of Telangana serves as the second name of Silver Filigree. The craft of making silver filigree was traditionally adopted as livelihood by the people of this region for generations during the19th and 20th centuries.
Since 19th Century AD, the very talented craftsmen of Karimnagar fashioned rich intricate trellis/Jali made of twisted silver wire. The locals say that this unique craft was adopted some 200 years ago by the Elgandal town near the Karimnagar district in Telangana and it later moved to the Karimnagar town in the first decade of the 20th Century. After digging deep about how this craft emerged, it has been understood that this craft was introduced by a widely travelled professional goldsmith, Kadarla Ramayya, who was a native of Yalagandala, who learned and absorbed this filigree jewel technique and craft. In Telugu parlance, filigree is called as, vendi teega pani (work done with silver wire).

Jagtial Fort
The history of Telangana Region is marked with bravery and sumptuousness. Marking a great significance to the splendor are the many forts of this region. Each and every fort is unique in its own way and forms an important part of the country's never ending glory. One such marvel is the Jagtial Fort in the Jagtial town in the Karimnagar district. The Jagtial fort can be called the shining star on the map of Karimnagar Tourism. The establishment of the beautiful fort dates back to the 17th century. It is believed that two European engineers Tal and Jack conceptualized and built this amazing star shaped fort which is surrounded by water. And an interesting thing about this fort is that it got its name after these two engineers, Jag-jack and Tial-Tal. Standing out as the structure built by foreign builders, every inch of this unique fort bears a strong similarity to a European castle. Though most of this fort is now in ruins; its uniqueness still makes it an interesting site, attracting scores of visitors.
The construction materials that were used to build this fort were mainly lime and stones. A huge wooden gate guarded the fort. However, the gate is long gone due to ravages of man and nature.. However, tourists may not be disappointed as the fort still recalls its days of glory with the huge cannons that are scattered throughout the premises.

Ujjaini Mahankali
Sri Ujjaini Mahankaali Temple is a popular temple devoted to Godess Mahankaali in Secunderabad area of Telangana. Devotees offer their prayers to the goddess every day at this 190-year old temple.
According to legend, in the year 1813, a Military Battalion was transferred to Ujjaini. This was a time when there was Cholera outbreak and thousands of people had reportedly perished. Suriti Appaiah who was part of the Military Battalion and his associates reportedly went to Mahankali Devasthanam at Ujjaini and offers prayers that if the people were saved from this epidemic, they would be installing the idol of Mahankaali at Secunderabad. Promptly after his return from Ujjaini, Sri Suriti Appaiah and his associates went ahead and installed the idol of Goddess Mahankaali which was made of wood at Secunderabad in July 1815. During the construction of sanctum sanctorum, a stone idol of Manikyalamma was reportedly found and even that idol was reportedly installed beside Sri Mahankaali Ammavaru.
Sri Suriti Appaiah later developed the temple with the help of philanthropic people and this was eventually taken over by the endowments department. Thousands of devotees offer prayers during Ashada jathara, which usually falls on Sunday and Monday.
The goddess Ujjain Mahankaali is seen in a Padmasana posture with four hands along with a sword, spear and also a essel of amrut damaru in the form of a beautiful stone idol. The idol is covered with silver and devotees make sacrifices after fulfillment of their wishes.

While there are the busy IT parks in the cyber city, there is this complete antithesis of the megacity, a park that calms your senses and soothes your mind. The Kasu Bramhananda Reddy National Park is teeming with life that is not very sophisticated, more primitive and uncivilized and yet, so enlightening and exotically beautiful. This place is also called the KBR National Park, and yes, this is a must visit place.
Established in the year 1994 with an aim to protect the richness and biodiversity of the area it is built on, the enchanting Kasu Bramhananda Reddy National Park is sprawled over an area of about 156 hectares in the lush lanes of Hyderabad’s Jubilee Hills.

Mrugavani National Park
The present day world has created its orbit around technology and modernism. The modern way of living has extensive demands and more and more of our Earth’s space and resources is what is at stake for. One can observe that national parks have eventually become the last sights of refuge for most indigenous species of animals as well as plants around the globe. Even governments of several countries have now become conscious of the importance of preserving these last species in wildlife sanctuaries.
The Mrugavani National Park in the state capital is an example of a beautiful national park turned major tourist attraction. What is most exciting is that in a land layered with exotic and immense natural resources like in India, it sure is a great achievement. The Mrugavani National Park, located at Chilkuru in Moinabad, is at a distance of about 25 kms from Hyderabad. The National Park is spread over 3.5 sq kms of pure, untamed land. The Indian government announced it a wildlife sanctuary in the year 1994 and since then, the park has been home to some 600 species of plants and animals. Like in the case of most national parks, even the Mrugavani national park has had least human intervention and interaction in order to make sure that all the precious creatures remain undisturbed in their cozy natural habitat.
We can see that the park has a topography made up of several rocky exposures that are characteristic of Deccan formation. The fauna of the wildlife sanctuary is as varied as they come. Foxes, black-naped hares, Wild boars, as well as Indian vipers are the most striking species for the curious traveler.

Peddamma Temple
One of the most revered temples of Hyderabad is the Peddamma Temple in Jubilee Hills. There is no clear evidence on when the temple was established, but people consider that it has been here since 150 years. Earlier, it was a small temple but in the year 1993, it gained immense popularity and the Rajagopuram was constructed. The temple witnesses hundreds of devotees pouring in everyday to seek the blessings of Amma. The Peddamma Temple is quite popular in the twin cities, next only to Ujjaini Mahakali Gudi of Secunderabad. The temple is dedicated to Ammavaru who is seen as the mother and people coming to this temple believe that the Goddess is their saviour. The Telangana festival Bonalu is celebrated once in a year, but at this temple, the Bonalu utsavam is celebrated every Sunday. Besides the common people, scores of VIPs, politicians and industrialists visit this temple to offer prayers to the Amma.
According to the legend, Lord Shiva, the supreme ascetic, when disturbed by the hostility opened his third eye, which led to the unleashing of fire of doom. Even this couldn't arrest Mahishasura's march. At that moment, a bright stream of lightning dazzled from the mouths of the creator Brahma, in the form of Goddess Brahmi. Simultaneously, the powers of all the other gods became taking one female form as Mahishasura Mardini, Durga, who killed Mahishasura with her bare hands. The temple is located close to the main road on Jubilee Hills Road No. 55 on the main thoroughfare from Jubilee Hills check post to Hi-tech city.

Balkampet Yellamma Temple
One of the old and among the most revered temples of Hyderabad is the Yellamma Temple located at Balkampet, popularly called the Balkampet Yellamma temple. The temple is thronged by heavy crowd on Sundays and Tuesdays and is quite famous for the annual Bonalu Jathara festivity that takes place in Hyderabad.
This temple is dedicated to Goddess Yellamma that literally means 'mother of the universe'. There is also an alternative name called Jagadamba who is considered the same as Goddess Renuka. According to a legend, Renuka, the daughter of Raja Renuka had married Jamadagni, the son of Satyawati and had five sons, one of them being Parashurama. One day, Renuka couldn't perform one of her regular household chores and this enraged her husband who then asked her to leave the house.Dejected Renuka was reportedly suggested by saints to perform pujas near a Shivalinga and feed Brahmins for her penance. Jamadagni was reportedly furious at her and demanded his sons as well to punish their mother Renuka. Others refused and they were burnt to ashes by the father's gaze while Parashurama searched for his mother who was hiding in a village, beheaded her and even the poor woman who helped her. Jamadagni who was pleased by his son's obedience, gave him a boon and in turn Parashurama asked his father to restore the lives of his brothers, his mother and the village woman. However, during the process, the head of Renuka was restored on the other woman's head and vice versa. While Jamadagni accepted the woman who had Renuka's body, the other form came to be popular known as Yellamma, which means mother to all and is being devoutly worshipped from then by the people ofTelangana people.
Balkampet Yellamma Goddess is also considered as an incarnation of Goddess Kali. Devotees offer animal sacrifice here. The most important event here is the celestial marriage ceremony of the temple goddess, Yellamma Kalyanotsavam. Bonalu Jathara Festival at Balkampet Yellamma Temple falls in the calendar only after Golconda Bonalu Jathara followed by Ujjaini Mahankali Bonalu Jathara each year.
The temple was first constructed in 15th Century AD and later renovated in the early 20th century. The idol of the goddess here is seen 10 feet lower than the ground level and the devouts believe that the water in the well here can cure all ailments. The holy water is treated as Theertham. The temple also has Akhand Jyothi, which was lit during the renovation. It is situated at a distance of 10 km from Secunderabad Railway Station and is just 3 km away from Ameerpet junction.

Divine in Warangal
Sammakka Saralamma Temple
The Sammakka Saralamma temple in Warangal was built during the 12th century. This temple has no mythological background relating to the construction of the temple; instead, it is believed to be built in the memory of two tribal women. The main deity(s) of the Sammakka Saralamma temple are two brave women who stood up for their community and its betterment. They became Martyrs in the battle. According to the legend, once a troop from the Koya tribal community was returning from a trip, when they saw a little girl playing with the tigress. The head of the troop saw the girl and inspired by her bravery, he adopted her and named her as Samakka. Later she married a headman of a neighboring tribal group and had a daughter, Sarakka. Both the mother and daughter protested the Kakatiya kings who forced the tribes to pay taxes. Both the women fought bravely and reportedly lost their lives. The Koya community constructed this temple as a token of gratitude. Annually an event called Sammakka Saralamma jatara is held which is considered as one of the largest tribal festivals of the world. The deities are brought from the forest to a spot for a period of 10-12 days when more than one crore devotees offer prayers and gift 'bangaram', which is pure jaggery to the deities. The entire place reverberates with divine chants and elaborate arrangements are made for this Jathara with thousands of buses plying to and fro with pilgrims.

Mrugavani National Park
The present day world has created its orbit around technology and modernism. The modern way of living has extensive demands and more and more of our Earth’s space and resources is what is at stake for. One can observe that national parks have eventually become the last sights of refuge for most indigenous species of animals as well as plants around the globe. Even governments of several countries have now become conscious of the importance of preserving these last species in wildlife sanctuaries.
The Mrugavani National Park in the state capital is an example of a beautiful national park turned major tourist attraction. What is most exciting is that in a land layered with exotic and immense natural resources like in India, it sure is a great achievement. The Mrugavani National Park, located at Chilkuru in Moinabad, is at a distance of about 25 kms from Hyderabad. The National Park is spread over 3.5 sq kms of pure, untamed land. The Indian government announced it a wildlife sanctuary in the year 1994 and since then, the park has been home to some 600 species of plants and animals. Like in the case of most national parks, even the Mrugavani national park has had least human intervention and interaction in order to make sure that all the precious creatures remain undisturbed in their cozy natural habitat.
We can see that the park has a topography made up of several rocky exposures that are characteristic of Deccan formation. The fauna of the wildlife sanctuary is as varied as they come. Foxes, black-naped hares, Wild boars, as well as Indian vipers are the most striking species for the curious traveler.

Durgam Cheruvu Boating
Hyderabad has many glorious places to its array of perfect getaways and leisure destinations. The royal city of Nawabs is home to a secret lake, which is popularly known as the Durgam Cheruvu.
Durgam Cheruvu is in a secluded location that is spread over an area of sixty-three acres and is a picturesque location surrounded by green pastures and scenic hills of the Deccan Plateau. The reason behind this intriguing name is indistinct but old timers assert that for many years the lake remained hidden as there were no roads to reach the place and it was well kept away from naked eye for twenty years.
The lake is shielded by granite rocks that are said to be only one of its kinds in entire Asia. The stones date back to more than some 2,500 million years. Nature lovers are very attracted to this place.
This secret lake is situated close to Shilparamam craft village and the city’s software hub, Hitech city. The lake has now been developed into a haven for visitors. The tourism department has introduced boating facilities to lure people into visiting this exotic place. The visitors throng this place for the entertaining activities like fishing, which is very rare in the city. This appealing lake serves as one best place for the film shootings. It is also the most recommended picnic spot for busy Hyderabadis who look for a rejuvenating weekend.
Telangana Tourism Initiative
The tourism department initiated steps in 2001 for promoting the lake as a tourist destination. As a part of this plan, five boats were to be deployed at the lake. In 2002, the lake is considered as an ideal destination for people who intend to indulge in fishing as a pastime. The lake has been adorned with various beautification steps while the area surrounding the lake has been illuminated with artificial waterfalls, a rock garden and a floating fountain were added. In addition to this, a 2-kilometer walkway was created and opened for public.
For heritage lovers, the rocks of this lake are living fossils while nature enthusiasts collect specimens from the lake and the shrubs nearby which is replete with good flora and fauna.
Facilities
The Tourism Department has provided camping, pedal boating, and trekking facilities. The park on the top is a perfect place to spend a quiet evening and watch the sun set. The water during sunset takes a golden colour and the lush green trees surrounding it make it a wonderful sight. There is yet another view of the secret lake, from the road that is equally beautiful, where one can spot peacocks and birds in the early mornings. There is also a well-maintained restaurant for people looking for food and refreshments.
Boating of all types such as Mechanized Boat, Water Scooter & Pedal Boat is readily available here, a major highlight of the lake. The trip on a mechanized boat is very much thrilling as it takes tourists from one end of the lake to the other. Similarly, a ride on a putty’, that has been newly introduced, is indeed quite thrilling and it costs you around Rs. 20/- per trip.
Added attractions
Adventure activities such as rock climbing, trekking, rappelling, an art gallery and a sculptor park for artists are now some of the added attractions. It also has an amphitheater, with a capacity to hold 1,500 people at a time. Youngsters of Hyderabad and some adventure clubs organize trekking activities at Durgam Cheruvu during weekends, which are a big draw.
The lighting facility in the backdrop of heritage rocks here adds a completely different dimension to the beauty of the lake. The silent chirps of birds and the easy access to Hyderabad’s IT corridor has earned Durgam Cheruvu a unique name and is frequented by employees of the technology companies located close by.

Nature Discovery in Telangana :: Telangana Tourism
Nature in Nirmal
Kuntala Waterfalls
Around 261 kms from Hyderabad, is a very beautiful waterfall in the Adilabad district of Telangana. After reaching Nirmal you will have to travel a stretch of 10 Km of ghat road which provides you a thrilling experience through dense forest. If you love long and adventurous rides, this road is a must try.
After travelling around 30 Km you will reach a village called Neredikonda. A right turn into a small road just after this village, takes you to your destination. One has to be a little conscious here as there is no sign board that directs to the waterfalls. After driving straight for around 10 Km, cutting your way through lush green fields, and a dense forest, your eyes will open up to heaven on earth. The place is hidden from the noisy external world and offers you the best of nature. It is covered with valleys, dense forest, and chirping birds. After entering the area, you will have to walk around half a kilometer and you will reach a place where you find a series of 408 steps down to the waterfalls. 408! But a little effort may heal your heart. And then, you gaze at the amazing waterfalls. One simply falls short of words to describe this untouched beauty. To add adventure, you can enjoy trekking though big boulders to reach the footsteps of the waterfalls. The water gushes through rocks making its own path from a height of 200 feet and splits in to multiple streams. While there are many such scenic waterfalls, this one is just so amazing and very accessible. Climbing up further to reach to top of falls may seem as a good idea, but one has to be very careful as it is too steep and very risky.

Durgam Cheruvu
Hyderabad has many glorious feathers to its hat. The royal city of Nawabs is home to a secret lake which is popularly known as the Durgam Cheruvu. This secret lake is situated close to Shilparamam craft village, at the city’s software hub, Hitech city. The reason behind this intriguing name is indistinct but old timers assert that for many years the lake remained hidden as there were no roads to reach the place and it was well kept away from naked eye for twenty years. The Durgam Cheruvu is a secluded location that is spread over an area of sixty-three acres and is a picturesque location surrounded by green pastures and scenic hills of the Deccan Plateau. This secret lake has now been developed into a haven for visitors. The authorities maintaining the lake have introduced boating facilities to lure the people visiting the exotic place. The visitors throng this place for the entertaining activities like fishing, which is very rare in the city. There is a restaurant for people looking for some refreshments. This appealing lake serves as one best place for the film shootings. It is also the most recommended picnic spot for busy Hyderabadis who look for a rejuvenating weekend. The lake is shielded by granite rocks which are said to be only one of its kinds in entire Asia. The stones date back to more than some 2,500 million years. Nature lovers are very attracted to this place. The Tourism Department has provided camping, pedal boating, and trekking facilities.

One visit to this place and it is like looking into the eyes of the wild beast residing in the forest. The reserve is so vast that it is not possible to see the entire forest at one go.
The sanctuary lies in the catchment area of the River Krishna. Adding to the exquisiteness of the sanctuary is that the reserve is surrounded by the Nallamala Hills on the eastern and southern side while the River Krishna adds as a silver lining on the other side.
The Nagarjunasagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve lies in the area of tropical dry and deciduous forest. Ziziphus xylopyrus, Cissus vitiginea, Niebuhria apetala and Pterolobium indicum are some of the plants of the region. The sanctuary has a wide range of fauna which includes bonnet macaque, tiger, leopard, langur, wild dog, wolf, jackal, jungle cat, sloth bear, giant flying squirrel, smooth-coated otter, Bengal fox, striped hyena, wild boar, palm civet, Indian muntjac, sambar, Indian spotted chevrotain, spotted deer, four-horned antelope, blackbuck, nilgai, Indian pangolin, Indian porcupine, chinkara and Indian tree shrew.

Mallela Theertham Waterfall
It is necessary that every person has to break the shell and start exploring new places once in a while. You don’t have to pack your bags and go off shores to enjoy a holiday and explore new places, look around and you will find many enthralling places in Telangana itself. One such amazing place you must see is the Mallela Theertham. This waterfall is a true gift of nature. Located in a valley, this exquisite place takes nestling at the Nallamala forest Range.
The waterfall runs down with all its energy, making its own path and breaking free from the heart of a dense forest. The amazing sight calls for attention, because you just can’t miss looking at heaven. The fall is directed on small Shivling, and the height of the waterfall is about 150 feet. Though the flow gets narrow in summers, the place looks beautiful throughout the year. The water that flows through the dense Nallamala forest belongs to a small stream, which later becomes one with the mighty river Krishna.
What adds the exquisiteness is that the Nallamala Forest is the largest stretch of undisturbed deciduous forest in south India. Mallela Theertham is located approximately 190 kilometers from Hyderabad on the way to the holy city of Srisailam. The location also lures adventure seekers as it serves an excellent host for River crossing, Trekking, Sliding, and Camp Fire.

Koilsagar Dam
The Koilsagar Dam is located in Koilsagar Village of the Deverakadra Mandal in the Mahabubnagar District of Telangana. Swelling with water, the Koilsagar Dam is one of the most preferred tourist attractions of Mahabubnagar.
The Koilsagar Dam is a medium sized irrigation project which was constructed at a cost of Rs 80 crores during the glorious period of the Nizams during 1945-48. The British rulers had proposed the idea of constructing a dam to collect and store the excess water in region at the catchment area of the River Krishna for irrigation purposes. The first stone of foundation for the project was laid in the year 1947 soon after the country got Independence. The Koilsagar Dam’s construction was completed in 1954 and it was inaugurated by the honourable Agricultural Minister of India, Shri K. M. Kharju.
This project is located at about 12 Kilometers from Devarakadra Mandal headquarters between the districts Mahaboobnagar and Raichur. The Koilsagar project was constructed to serve the irrigation needs up to about 12 thousand acres. This dam can be called a beauty with a purpose, as it is constructed in a very picturesque location in between two mountains on the Peddavagu River. Near the project is a beautiful guest house which opens up to a beautiful view of the project.
The Koilsagar Dam, which is about 8 kilometers from the Koil konda village, stretches its power across the Peddavagu River, which is a minor tributary of the River Krishna. We can find some elegantly curved hills on the western stretch, making it a perfect tourist spot.

History of Telangana :: Visit Telangana - Official Tourism Information for Telangana
History of Telangana
The name "Telangana" refers to the word Trilinga Desa, earned due to the presence of three ancient Shiva Temples at Kaleshwaram, Srisailam, and Draksharamam. A more historical reasoning is that during the reign of Nizams, the region was known as Telugu Angana to differentiate it from the areas where Marathi was spoken.
Telangana region has been ruled by great dynasties such as Sathavahanas, Kakatiyas, Chalukyas, Mughals, Qutubshahis, Asafjahis. Kakathiyas contributions to architecture are considered most impressive while Sathavahanas ruled Telangana region for about 400 years right from the 2nd century B.C. to beyond the 2nd century A.D. Among Kakathiyas, Prataparudra, was a great ruler who ruled till A.D.1323.
During the rule of Bahamani, Quli Qutub, born in Persia, came to Deccan and he had become the Governor of this region. Quli Qutub later became independent and formed his own Qutubshahi Dynasty in 1518. The Golkonda fort was built by Quli qutub. In his reign, two tanks such as Ibrahim Pantam tank and Hussainsagar were built including a bridge on river Musi, which is known as Puranapul. The Hindus of Telangana region remember him for his immense patronage of Telugu literature. Many Telugu poets such as Addanki Gangadhar Kavi, Panuganti Telanganarya, Kandukuri Rudra Kavi had flourished in his court.
Qutubshah then shifted the capital from Golkonda to Hyderabad on the banks of the river Musi. He built the Jamia mosque at Charminar. The State of Hyderabad was eventually founded by Mir Qamruddin Chin Qilich Khan. Later, he conferred himself the title of Asaf Jah, by which title the dynasty is still known.
The Indian Government refused to entertain a request that Hyderabad would seek a separate status and Operation Polo was initiated to annex Hyderabad state. The Kannada and Marathi speaking areas of Hyderabad state was then merged with Karnataka and Maharashtra respectively while Telugu speaking region of Telangana was merged with Andhra state with Hyderabad as the capital of united Andhra Pradesh state in 1956. Although there was resentment against the merger, there was a period of calm.

promote the picturesque locales of Jetprolu and Somasila, with
Srisailam backwaters providing ample scope for boating and recreation,
shows the long way we have traveled after Telangana formation.
According to a survey by the Airports Council International (ACI),
Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport has been rated as the
world number one in the 5-15 million passengers per annum category.
The fact that Hyderabad airport has won this prestigious award for the
fourth time in the last 10 years in this specific category, is a
matter of pride for the state of Telangana.
With aggressive strides in every arena, Telangana within a short time
has created a great buzz with its impressive and stellar growth in
every sphere. Telangana Tourism remains committed to aid the growth
story of the state, with its development plans and strategies to
attract more domestic and international tourists.
India Leadership Forum has been held for the first time out of Mumbai,
this time in Hyderabad, while the National Association of Software and
Services Companies (Nasscom) also hosted the prestigious World
Congress on Information Technology (WCIT) in the city. These events go
a long way in showing the success of the industry friendly policies of
the Telangana state government.
It is a matter of pride to see the spirit of our women, coming forward to promote Telangana Tourism. A women biker team from Telangana are all set to embark on a ride which takes them to seven countries, covering about 17,000 km. We extend our complete support to their efforts in showcasing the rich culture, heritage and tourism destinations of the state.
A memorable travel experience awaits you. The state of Telangana with popular tourist attractions and great hospitality offers you the best of what you expect in your travel itinerary. We welcome you to India's youngest and rapidly developing state.
A Great Honour For Hyderabad
A moment of reckoning for our city, Hyderabad. It is a matter of pride and satisfaction to see Hyderabad emerging as the best city in terms of quality of living among Indian cities for the third consecutive year, according to Mercer's Quality of Living rankings 2017. Mercer’s survey is rated as one of the most comprehensive surveys done annually which enables multinational companies and other employers in compensating employees fairly, related to international assignments. This is indeed a great honour for Hyderabad.

The readers voted for Telangana Tourism in the category of Best State as part of the reader polls on digital platforms (website and tablet edition).

It is a matter of pride for us to state that Telangana has maintained its track record of attracting hundreds of thousands of new foreign tourists in the recent years, with 2017 alone witnessing a massive 2.47 lakh foreign visitors to the city of Hyderabad.  The spike in overall numbers is very significant, with an increase of about 85,000 visitors compared to 2016, and nearly 1,25,000 visitors compared to the year 2015.
The State Government of Telangana has been vigorously promoting
                                        several destinations in the region, catering to the growing needs of
                                        the visiting tourists. By creating a separate identity and building a
                                        brand called Telangana Tourism, we are consolidating the status of
                                        Hyderabad as a global tourist destination whilst attracting the
                                    tourists even to lesser known destinations!
It is a matter of pride to see Hyderabad maintain its leading rank as
the best city to live in India, among Indian cities in the latest
Mercer Quality of Living Rating 2018. Hyderabad was able to retain its
position as the top Indian city for the fourth consecutive year, which
is a testimony to the city’s appeal as a promising and popular
destination.

of exotic tourist destinations and other attractions. Our emphasis to

To make the beautifulflowers carpet for Bathukamma , if any of the flowers specifically mentioned below; like ‘GummadiPuvvu’(Pumpkinflower),‘Thangedu’and‘GunuguPuvvulu’(flowers)and‘GummadiAakulu’(leavesofaPumpkinplant)arenotavailable; you may arrange Bathukamma with which ever flowers you can procure.
Depending on the size of Bathukamma you want to arrange,you will have to procure suitable quantity and types of flowers.
Pick up a suitable round steel or a brass plate with a small edge. The Bathukamma in the above picture is arranged on a 12 inch plate. For first attempt , you can arrange Bathukamma on an 8 inch plate or even a smaller one.
Lay two pieces of thread on the plate perpendicular to one another and passing over the centre of the plate. These threads should belong enough , so that after arranging the entire Bathukamma in a conical pattern , these threads are drawn upwardsand tied at the top to hold the Bathukamma intact.
Over the plate and the threads,place a‘Vistharaku’(a plate madeout of  leaves).And trim the edges of the‘Vistharaku’to match the circular base of the metal plate.
Spread a thin layer of Pumpkin leaves over the‘Vistharaku’.
Arrange one layer of ‘ThangeduPuvvulu’(Thangeduflowers).These tiny yellow flowers with green buds and leaves and longstems are available at the time of Bathukamma festival.
The next layer of flowers is with ‘GunuguPuvvulu’.‘Gunugu’ flowers with longstems running almost upto the centre of the plate are now arranged radially. You can arrange the row of‘Gunugu’flowers to any reasonable width taking care that the layer is gradually tapering to finally give a conical shape to Bathukamma.The protruding parts of the‘GunuguPuvvulu’can betrimmed.
The hollow that is forming at the centre as you are radially arranging the flowers can be filled with Pumpkin leaves,or any other leaves or loose flowers.
Subsequent top layers/rows may be arranged with any colourful flowers like yellow and orange ‘BanthiPuvvulu’(Marigoldflowers),‘ChamanthiPuvvulu’(Chrysanthemumflowers)and any other colourful flowers and even with some artificially coloured flowers specially made available for Bathukamma festival.If the flowers do not have stems or the stems are not strong enough,pieces of broomsticks are inserted into the flowers to act as stems and help in arranging and holding the flowers together.
At the very top,a Pumpkin flower is placed.
Finally the loose ends of the two threads placed over the bottom plate and under the ‘Vistharaku’are drawn up and tied at the top to hold the ‘Vistharaku’and the flowers arranged over it(Bathukamma)in position.
Towards the end of Bathukamma celebrations, Bathukamma is
given a traditional farewell (‘Saaganampadam’) by placing Bathukamma over a water body –a river or lake. Bathukamma is placed over the surface of water and the plate on which it is arranged is cautiously takenout.Our colourful Bathukamma now standing on the‘Vistharaku’can be seen graciously floating. Watching hundreds of families dressedin their best attire and happily playing colourful Bathukammas of different sizes along the shore and then seeing countless Bathukammas floating and dancing with the waves in the lake or river is a very grand and happy sight,beyond description.

Batukamma celebrates the inherent relationship between earth, water and the human beings. During the entire preceding week, women make ‘boddemma’ (a deity of Gowri – mother Durga – made with earthly mud) along with Batukamma and immerse it in the pond. This helps reinforce the ponds and helps it retain more water.

In times where the fresh water ponds are gradually diminishing and dwindling away it is indeed a pride of Telangana that its womenfolk (with mostly agrarian background) inherently know how to make them better by celebrating the beauty of nature. It is something we indeed have to feel proud of.

According to the Hindu religious scholars and pundits, once upon a time there was a King named Dharmangada who belonged to the Chola Dynasty. This particular king largely ruled over South India. His wife gave birth to a girl child after many years of rituals and prayer. She was named as Princess Lakshmi.

During Baby Lakshmi brought up she survived many unforeseen accidents and incidents in life. The parents felt life and death while bring up their only child. Later they named their daughter as Bathukamma. According to the Telugu language, Bathuku means life and Amma means a female names and mother.
On the other hand, married women along with their household friends and relatives celebrate this festival in order to pray to the Goddess for prosperity and good health of their family. This particular festival is primarily celebrated by unmarried young girls who are in the marriageable age. On the other hand men folks along with their wife’s and other family members, relatives and friends help in the gathering of flowers and floral arrangement of a beautiful flower stack during the festival season.
This festival is plays a vital role in the culture and tradition of telangana region of Telangana. Every year, Bathukamma festival is eagerly looked forward by the Hindu religious people.
Bathukamma festival has many myths behind its festivity. According to the Hindu religious scholars and pundits, one myth regarding Goddess Gauri is that she after a fierce fight killed ‘Mahishasura’ the demon. After this serious act, she went into deep sleep due to fatigue on the ‘Aswayuja Padyami’ day. All the Hindu religious devotees strongly prayed with devotion and dedication for her to wake up. It is to be noted that she woke up on the Dasami day.
The other version of Bathukamma is that there was a king named Dharmangada and a queen named Satyavati belonging to Chola Dynasty. They lost their hundred sons in the war front. So they prayed and performed ritual to Goddesses Lakshmi to be born as their daughter. The Goddesses heard it and immediately obliged them. On her birth, many scholar and pundits visited the baby at the royal palace and blessed her by calling Bathukamma or live forever.
Another version says that Parvathi or Batakamma is a adherent lover of flowers. The seasonal flowers of spring are arranged on a square bamboo frame or square wooden plank with the size of frames that is hardly tapering off to directly form a pinnacle on the top. It looks like the shape of a temple tower or ‘Gopura’. On top of the flowers, a lump of turmeric is kept. The worship of Goddess Batakamma is done with this little floral is mountain.
This festival belongs to the women folk of Telangana region. Then men and children participate with lot of interest and enthusiasm in this festivity. The young unmarried girls play a active role in this festival.

ABOUT BATHUKAMMA
The unique festival of flowers in Telangana
Bathukamma is a colourful and vibrant festival of Telangana and celebrated by women, with flowers that grow exclusively in each region. This festival is a symbol of Telangana’s cultural identity.

Bathukamma comes during the latter half of monsoon, before the onset of winter. The monsoon rains usually brings plenty of water into the fresh water ponds of Telangana and it is also the time when wild flowers bloom in various vibrant colors all across the uncultivated and barren plains of the region. The most abundant of these are the ‘gunuka poolu’ and ‘tangedu poolu’. There are other flowers too like the banti, chemanti, nandi-vardhanam etc. Bathukamma is celebrated by the women folk of Telangana, heralding the beauty of nature in vibrant colors of multitudinous flowers.
The festival begins a week before the grand ‘Saddula Batukamma’ (the grand finale of the Batukamma festival) which falls two days before Dussehra. The women folk normally get back to their parent's home from their in-laws and breathe the fresh air of freedom to celebrate the colors of flowers. For one complete week, they make small ‘Batukammas’, play around them every evening and immerse them in a nearby water pond. On the last day, the men folk of the house go into the wild plains and gather the flowers like gunuka and tangedi. They bring home bagfuls of these flowers and the entire household sits down to make the big ‘Batukamma’. The flowers are carefully arranged row after row in a brass plate (called taambalam) in circular rows and in alternate colors.
								As evening approaches the women folk dress colourfully with the best of their attire and adorn lot of ornaments and place the Batukamma in their courtyard. The women of neighborhood also gather in a large circle around it. They start singing songs by circling it repeatedly, building a beautiful human circle of unity, love, sisterhood.
After playing in circles around the “Batukammalu”, before the onset of dusk, the women folk carry them on their heads and move as a procession towards a bigger water body near the village or town. The procession is extremely colourful with the decorations of women and the “Batukammalu”. Songs of folklore are sung in chorus throughout the procession and the streets resonate with them. Finally, when they reach the water pond the “Batukammalu” are slowly immersed into water after some more playing and singing. Then they share the ‘maleeda’ (a dessert made with sugar or raw sugar and corn bread) sweets amongst the family members and neighborhood folks. They return to their homes with empty ‘taambaalam’ singing songs in praise of Batukamma. The songs of Batukamma echo in the streets until late night during the entire week.
Batukamma celebrates the inherent relationship between earth, water and the human beings. During the entire preceding week, women make ‘boddemma’ (a deity of Gowri – mother Durga – made with earthly mud) along with Batukamma and immerse it in the pond. This helps reinforce the ponds and helps it retain more water. The flowers used in Batukamma have a great quality of purifying water and such flowers when immersed in abundance into the pond have the effect of cleansing the water and making the environment much better. In times where the fresh water ponds are gradually diminishing and dwindling away it is indeed a pride of Telangana that its womenfolk (with mostly agrarian background) inherently know how to make them better by celebrating the beauty of nature. It is something we indeed have to feel proud of. The festival heralds the beauty of nature, collective spirit of Telangana people, the indomitable spirit of women folks and also the scientific approach of the agrarian people towards preserving the resources of nature in a celebrative way. Hence, Bathukamma is the icon of cultural identity of Telangana.

Edupayala Vana Durga Bhavani Temple
8 Kms from Medak District at Edupayala is the Edupayala Vana Durga Bhavani temple dedicated to the most powerful Goddess Kanakadurga. According to the legend, Maharaja Parikshit (the grandson of the great warrior Arjun) performed "Sarpa Yagya" to get rid of a curse. And when Garuda, the eagle, was transporting the snakes used in the Yagna, their blood is said to have fallen in seven different places. And the place where blood spilled became streams. All the seven streams meet here at Edupayala to form river Manjeera. This picturesque location marks the confluences of these seven rivulets into the Manjeera River and hence the name Edupayala, which in Telugu means Edu (seven) and Payalu (streams).
The Edupayala Durga Bhavani temple is a highly revered shrine of goddess Durga bhavani in the Telangana state. Edupayalu is an unusual place with many natural stone formations. On the day of Shivaratri and Maagha Amavaasya, the locals celebrate a jatara.

Rachakonda Fort
Telangana region is the home of the incredible Rachakonda Fort. The fort stands as a glorious demonstration of the Vemula rulers and their power. The fort is currently in ruins. However, this epitome of the marveling medieval Hindu art and culture still attracts scores of people. Another striking feature of this temple is that it perfectly adheres to the principles of Vasthu Shastra, which influences most of the Hindu architectures.
The Velama rulers, the kings who built this small but very strong Rachakonda fort, had established their throttlehold over the Telangana region after the Kakatiyas and before the Bahamani era.
The fort is built in two floors. The fort displays a breath taking view of the entire city, when you stand at the fort’s South East corner. The entrance of the Rachakonda fort serves as an outstanding example of monolith pillars. The uniqueness of this fort lies in its construction; it has been built without using any mortar in cyclopean masonry. The fort is also adored with beams and lintels with enthralling rock cut walls. Each and every inch of this fort provides plenty of fodder to feed the high appetite of history lovers.
The history of the Rachakonda fort is intricately woven with the history of the velama rulers. According to the legend, the Velama rulers were wrapped in pride and believed that they were invincible. This increasing pride made them impose several carnages on their people. Women were humiliated the most, and one such woman, cursed the rulers of facing failure in their objectives and then turned herself in to a stone. It is believed that this curse brought their downfall. The stone figure is still found in the fort premises.

The wax is replaced next by molten brass, gold, bronze or silver which is left for hardening inside the mould. The mould is subsequentlychipped away for retrieving the object inside. Finally it is polished and the finished product is put on display.

The designs made are metal figurines, elephants, folk motifs, peacocks, horses and also household articles such as measuring bowls. The work is popular across the domestic and international markets due to the aesthetic and primitive simplicity.

ABOUT BATHUKAMMA
The unique festival of flowers in Telangana
Bathukamma is a colourful and vibrant festival of Telangana and celebrated by women, with flowers that grow exclusively in each region. This festival is a symbol of Telangana’s cultural identity.

Bathukamma comes during the latter half of monsoon, before the onset of winter. The monsoon rains usually brings plenty of water into the fresh water ponds of Telangana and it is also the time when wild flowers bloom in various vibrant colors all across the uncultivated and barren plains of the region. The most abundant of these are the ‘gunuka poolu’ and ‘tangedu poolu’. There are other flowers too like the banti, chemanti, nandi-vardhanam etc. Bathukamma is celebrated by the women folk of Telangana, heralding the beauty of nature in vibrant colors of multitudinous flowers.
The festival begins a week before the grand ‘Saddula Batukamma’ (the grand finale of the Batukamma festival) which falls two days before Dussehra. The women folk normally get back to their parent's home from their in-laws and breathe the fresh air of freedom to celebrate the colors of flowers. For one complete week, they make small ‘Batukammas’, play around them every evening and immerse them in a nearby water pond. On the last day, the men folk of the house go into the wild plains and gather the flowers like gunuka and tangedi. They bring home bagfuls of these flowers and the entire household sits down to make the big ‘Batukamma’. The flowers are carefully arranged row after row in a brass plate (called taambalam) in circular rows and in alternate colors.
								As evening approaches the women folk dress colourfully with the best of their attire and adorn lot of ornaments and place the Batukamma in their courtyard. The women of neighborhood also gather in a large circle around it. They start singing songs by circling it repeatedly, building a beautiful human circle of unity, love, sisterhood.
After playing in circles around the “Batukammalu”, before the onset of dusk, the women folk carry them on their heads and move as a procession towards a bigger water body near the village or town. The procession is extremely colourful with the decorations of women and the “Batukammalu”. Songs of folklore are sung in chorus throughout the procession and the streets resonate with them. Finally, when they reach the water pond the “Batukammalu” are slowly immersed into water after some more playing and singing. Then they share the ‘maleeda’ (a dessert made with sugar or raw sugar and corn bread) sweets amongst the family members and neighborhood folks. They return to their homes with empty ‘taambaalam’ singing songs in praise of Batukamma. The songs of Batukamma echo in the streets until late night during the entire week.
Batukamma celebrates the inherent relationship between earth, water and the human beings. During the entire preceding week, women make ‘boddemma’ (a deity of Gowri – mother Durga – made with earthly mud) along with Batukamma and immerse it in the pond. This helps reinforce the ponds and helps it retain more water. The flowers used in Batukamma have a great quality of purifying water and such flowers when immersed in abundance into the pond have the effect of cleansing the water and making the environment much better. In times where the fresh water ponds are gradually diminishing and dwindling away it is indeed a pride of Telangana that its womenfolk (with mostly agrarian background) inherently know how to make them better by celebrating the beauty of nature. It is something we indeed have to feel proud of. The festival heralds the beauty of nature, collective spirit of Telangana people, the indomitable spirit of women folks and also the scientific approach of the agrarian people towards preserving the resources of nature in a celebrative way. Hence, Bathukamma is the icon of cultural identity of Telangana.

Bhadrachalam
Bhadrachalam is a key town of Pilgrimage importance located in the Khammam District of Telangana. The temple town of Bhadrachalam is situated on the banks of Godavari River. It was part of East Godavari District, Andhra Pradesh till 1959. The town is synonymous for its famous temple devoted to Lord Rama. Bhadrachalam Revenue division is considered one of the largest revenue divisions in the country, which was transferred to Khammam district of Telangana region for administrative purposes.
According to history, Paleolithic man had roamed the areas, which is called the lower Godavari valley that includes Bhadrachalam and its surroundings. Bhadrachalam town has a clearly documented history of Lord Sri Rama temple, which was constructed in the 17th Century CE. According to Mythology, the present town was once part of the Dandakaranya forest, which Lord Sri Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had visited during their exile also called vanavasam according to local parlance. The jungle which is now in the vicinity of temple was the place for Rama’s retreat and a place called Parnasala which is 32 km away was the location where Rama had built a dwelling for himself and Sita. It was here that Sita was abducted by Lanka ruler, Ravana.
The town shares its historical significance with Ramayana Era. The name Bhadrachalam is derived from the word Bhadragiri (The Mountain Abode of Bhadra, the child of Meru and Menaka). The famous temple at Bhadrachalam is home to the Archa Murthy’s of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana and their idols are believed to be swayambhu i.e. self-manifested ones.
Bhadrachalam division also has several other Hindu temples. Parnasala is believed to be the spot where Rama constructed a hermitage during his exile and spent time with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana. Agastya muni helped Rama select this spot. For the purpose of tourists, there is picturesque display of few scenes from vanavasa at Parnasala. Pilgrims enthrall when they see the footprints of Sita devi, the mosaic of Maarecha who appears in the guise of golden deer and Ravana who appears in the form of Sanyasi for Bhikshatana. One can see Sita Vaagu where Sita had bathed and gathered turmeric and Kunkum from the nearby stones. Yetapaka located 2 km from Bhadrachalam has a history where the bird Jatayuvu, an ardent devotee of Rama tried to obstruct Ravana when he was proceeding on a chariot after kidnapping Sita. A fierce batted ensued and a wing of the bird was believed to have found at Rekkapalli.
Rama is worshipped as Atmarama here at Dummugudem where according to Purana, Rama killed around 14,000 demons belonging to Khara and Dushana. The place is called Dummugudem as it was built on the ashes of these demons. At Gundala, located 5 km away from Bhadrachalam, once can see hot water springs after digging a pit on the riverbank and it is said that the divine trio of Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwara dipped in the holy water here during winter season. There are other places too like Sree Rama Giri, Venkatreddipeta, Gannavaram etc. The temple town witnesses heavy influx of pilgrims during Sree Rama Kalyanam.

Alampur Jogulamba Temple
Alampur is a sleepy town situated on the banks Tungabhadra River, in the state of Telangana. Alampur is considered as the western gateway of Srisailam. Here the marvelous temple and remains of some ancient temple signify Badami Chalukyan architecture. The region was ruled by many South Indian dynasties. The principal deities at the Jogulamba temple are Jogulamba and Balabrahmeshwara. Goddess Jogulamba is considered the 5th Shakti Peeta among 18 shakti peetams in the country. Here Goddess Jogulamba is seen seated on the Corpse with scorpion, frog, and lizard on the head. She is seen in a naked avtar with her tongue stretched outside, an avtar of fierce goddess that grants Siddhi in Yoga and hence called Jogulamba. This word is a changed form of Yogula Amma in Telugu which means Mother of Yogis.
According to a popular legend there was a great saint in 6th century called Rasa Siddha who had the power to convert base metal into gold and he was considered close to chalukya king Pulakesi II, instrumental in constructing any temples called ‘Nava Brahmas’. According to the legend, the nine names of Siva are actually the names of medicinal herbs put forth by Rasa Siddha and there are nine temples here. They are the Swarga Brahma Temple Padma Brahma Temple, Vishva Brahma Temple Arka Brahma Temple, Bala Brahma Temple, Garuda Brahma Temple, and Taraka Brahma Temple. The Siddha Rasarnavam is a tantric work, which states that if upasana is performed as per the prescribed Tantra, then Mercury oozes from the Linga of Bala Brahma, Thighs of Subramanya, Navel of Ganapati, and Mouth of Mother Jogulamba, which can be converted into Gold by using the medicinal herbs.
The popular temple stands as a testimony to Chalukya Art and Culture. The Tungabhadra and Krishna are seen in a confluence near Alampur, and hence it is also know known as Dakshina Kailasam. It is also said that Brahma had performed a great penance at today’s Alampur for thousands of years, and he pleased Lord Siva who conferred the powers of creation for him. Hence, the deity is also called Brahmeswara and the goddess as Yogini or Jogulamba, a synonym for mother Parvathi.

Batukamma celebrates the inherent relationship between earth, water and the human beings. During the entire preceding week, women make ‘boddemma’ (a deity of Gowri – mother Durga – made with earthly mud) along with Batukamma and immerse it in the pond. This helps reinforce the ponds and helps it retain more water.

In times where the fresh water ponds are gradually diminishing and dwindling away it is indeed a pride of Telangana that its womenfolk (with mostly agrarian background) inherently know how to make them better by celebrating the beauty of nature. It is something we indeed have to feel proud of.

To make the beautifulflowers carpet for Bathukamma , if any of the flowers specifically mentioned below; like ‘GummadiPuvvu’(Pumpkinflower),‘Thangedu’and‘GunuguPuvvulu’(flowers)and‘GummadiAakulu’(leavesofaPumpkinplant)arenotavailable; you may arrange Bathukamma with which ever flowers you can procure.
Depending on the size of Bathukamma you want to arrange,you will have to procure suitable quantity and types of flowers.
Pick up a suitable round steel or a brass plate with a small edge. The Bathukamma in the above picture is arranged on a 12 inch plate. For first attempt , you can arrange Bathukamma on an 8 inch plate or even a smaller one.
Lay two pieces of thread on the plate perpendicular to one another and passing over the centre of the plate. These threads should belong enough , so that after arranging the entire Bathukamma in a conical pattern , these threads are drawn upwardsand tied at the top to hold the Bathukamma intact.
Over the plate and the threads,place a‘Vistharaku’(a plate madeout of  leaves).And trim the edges of the‘Vistharaku’to match the circular base of the metal plate.
Spread a thin layer of Pumpkin leaves over the‘Vistharaku’.
Arrange one layer of ‘ThangeduPuvvulu’(Thangeduflowers).These tiny yellow flowers with green buds and leaves and longstems are available at the time of Bathukamma festival.
The next layer of flowers is with ‘GunuguPuvvulu’.‘Gunugu’ flowers with longstems running almost upto the centre of the plate are now arranged radially. You can arrange the row of‘Gunugu’flowers to any reasonable width taking care that the layer is gradually tapering to finally give a conical shape to Bathukamma.The protruding parts of the‘GunuguPuvvulu’can betrimmed.
The hollow that is forming at the centre as you are radially arranging the flowers can be filled with Pumpkin leaves,or any other leaves or loose flowers.
Subsequent top layers/rows may be arranged with any colourful flowers like yellow and orange ‘BanthiPuvvulu’(Marigoldflowers),‘ChamanthiPuvvulu’(Chrysanthemumflowers)and any other colourful flowers and even with some artificially coloured flowers specially made available for Bathukamma festival.If the flowers do not have stems or the stems are not strong enough,pieces of broomsticks are inserted into the flowers to act as stems and help in arranging and holding the flowers together.
At the very top,a Pumpkin flower is placed.
Finally the loose ends of the two threads placed over the bottom plate and under the ‘Vistharaku’are drawn up and tied at the top to hold the ‘Vistharaku’and the flowers arranged over it(Bathukamma)in position.
Towards the end of Bathukamma celebrations, Bathukamma is
given a traditional farewell (‘Saaganampadam’) by placing Bathukamma over a water body –a river or lake. Bathukamma is placed over the surface of water and the plate on which it is arranged is cautiously takenout.Our colourful Bathukamma now standing on the‘Vistharaku’can be seen graciously floating. Watching hundreds of families dressedin their best attire and happily playing colourful Bathukammas of different sizes along the shore and then seeing countless Bathukammas floating and dancing with the waves in the lake or river is a very grand and happy sight,beyond description.

Bidri Craft
This unique art of silver engraved on metal has always enthralled people with its lure.
Bidriware is a renowned metal handicraft that derives its name from Bidar, presently in Karnataka. It was believed to have originated in 14th century AD during the reign of Bahamani Sultans.
The term 'Bidriware' therefore represents the manufacture of a unique metalware that is named after the region of Bidar. The Bahamani sultans had ruled Bidar in the 14th–15th centuries. Bidriware was first practised in ancient Persia and then it was brought to India by Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti’s followers. The art form developed due to a mix of Persian and Arabic cultures and after the fusion with local style, a new and unique style of its own was created. The Nizam of Hyderabad introduced the art form in Aurangabad, which was part of Nizam’s Hyderabad state before 1947.
Bidriware is an eight-stage process. Those are moulding, smoothening by file and the process of designing by chisels. It is then followed by engraving using chisel and hammer where pure silver inlaying is done. It is subjected to smoothening again, followed by buffing and finally oxidising by making use of soil and ammonium chloride. Bidriware is therefore manufactured from an alloy of copper and zinc metals, in the ratio 1:16 by means of casting.
Initially the presence of zinc ushers alloy a deep black color. Firstly, a mould is created using soil and this is made malleable by adding castor oil and resin. The molten metal is later poured to create a cast piece followed by smoothened through filing. The casting is further coated with a strong copper sulphate solution to gain a temporary black coating. Then the designs are etched freehand over this using a metal stylus.This is eventually secured in a vise and the Bidri craftsmen make use of small chisels to engrave the designs over this freehand etching. Fine wire or even flattened strips of pure silver are clearly hammered into the grooves.The item is then filed and buffed, as well as smoothed to remove the temporary black coating. This results in a silver inlay that is not that clearly distinguishable compared to the gleaming metallic surface, which is now completely silvery white.
The Bidriware item is now completely set for a final blackening process. Here, makers use a special variety of soil that is available only in select places. This is mixed with ammonium chloride and water for producing a paste. The mixture is further rubbed onto a heated Bidri surface that darkens the body without affecting the silver inlay.The paste is clearly rinsed, revealing a shiny silver design looking stunning and resplendent against the rest of black surface. The oil is applied as a finishing touch for the product to strengthen the matt coating. The finished product is now shining black with a brilliant silver inlay.
The makers of Bidriware create designs like flowers, leaves and also geometric designs, stylized poppy plants, human figures etc. In some countries there is a great demand for the design of Persian roses and also the passages from the Holy Quran in the Arabic script.Bidriware was also used for making paanholders, hookahs, and vases as well as bowls, ornament boxes, earrings, trays and other jewelry and showpiece items.
The world famous artistic metallic Work which was on a decline few decades ago is currently on the revival path following the introduction of several innovative designs and new patterns.The designs represent Indian to international themes in tune with latest home and lifestyle needs and interior spaces. Bidar in Karnataka state and Hyderabad in Telangana are the popular centres for Bidriware in India and it is also practised in some of the other centres across India. Due to the striking inlay artWorks, Bidriware is considered an important export handicraft item from India’s handicraft market and seen as a prized symbol of wealth. This native art form has also gained the Geographical Indications (GI) registry.

Batik Paintings
These paintings represent a highly unique form of art involving various figures and patterns drawn on the pieces of fabrics
Batik painting is a highly beautiful and an ancient art form. Batik paintings represent a highly unique form of art involving various figures and patterns drawn on the pieces of fabrics. These paintings are believed to have originated in Indonesia wherein the original word referred to the dots on clothes.
Batik represents the wax-resist dye technique, used in textiles. This art is believed to be more than one thousand years old. Batik art work is widely practised in regions like Java (Indonesia) and India. India is known for its rich tradition in Batik paintings and truly exquisite works of Batik art continue to be procured from different regions of India.
Batik artists make use of dyes as color. This is an integral part of the batik art work. A batik artist should have a good sense of the colors and patterns. For creating an attractive piece of Batik painting, the batik artist works with more emphasis on color, wherein multiple layers of wax and dye is applied to the fabric.
Batik actually refers to a process of decorating cloth where one part of this cloth is covered with a coat of wax followed by dyeing of the cloth. The waxed areas would retain their original color and after wax is removed, the contrast levels between the dyed and the non-dyed areas give an attractive pattern.
The elaborate art of Batik is actually a three-stage process which involves stages like waxing, dyeing and also de-waxing (removing the wax). There are other sub-processes as well like preparing the cloths and the designs, where the cloth is stretched on the frame followed by waxing the area of the cloth that does not need dyeing. This is followed by preparing the dye, dipping the cloth in the dye and eventually boiling the cloth for removing wax and washing of the dyed cloth in soap. The entire process of waxing, dyeing and de-waxing is even repeated multiple times until the whole batik design or fabric is completed.
The characteristic designs of batik are observed due to the fine cracks appearing in the wax, which ensures that the small amounts of the dye, actually seeps in. Batik waxing is considered an important part of the entire process of batik printing. The common batik fabrics which are used for excellent batik prints are poplin, voiles, cambric, and pure silk. Natural colors that are derived from barks of trees, flower, leaves, and minerals are also used. Batik is also made in several ways such as screen-printing method, splash method, and the hand painting one with the help of a Kalamkari pen.
Each piece of Batik painting has a unique feel as a result of the endless combinations of the dye coloring, wax effects and the fabric types. The Batik painting technique also involves great precision and concentration. Batik wall hangings are considered a hot favourite with the art lovers.

Nirmal Paintings
This art form named after its place of origin, Nirmal is being practiced by the 'Naqash' right from the 14th century.
Nirmal town is located amidst the dense forests of the newly created Nirmal district (erstwhile Adilabad District) in Telangana. This town is considered the gifted land of art and crafts, and is popular all over the country. The art and craft community of craftsmen living in Nirmal are also called as ‘Naqash’. This town is quite famous for the Nirmal paintings and toys. From the rustic ethos to the royal environment, from flora to fauna, an explicit array of expressions is portrayed in myriad colours and forms on Nirmal products. This art form named after its place of origin, Nirmal is being practiced by the 'Naqash' right from the 14th century.
Nirmal Paintings depict the traditional art scenes related to the Hindu epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These paintings were influenced by the Indian Schools of Art like Kangra, Ajanta as well as Mughal miniatures. The evolution of the Nirmal art and craft is also traced back to the old era of Kakatiya dynasty. The Mughal rulers were so enraptured by the Nirmal paintings, that they patronized this art greatly.
It is said that once the Nizam of Hyderabad was accorded a grand welcome when he visited Nirmal. The artisans decorated the venue and the seat of the Nizam in a grand manner with an intricately designed banana bud, believed to have been suspended over the Nizam’s seat. This was unfurled while there was a cascade of golden petals showered on him. This led to the Nizam patronizing the artisans, impressed by their skill. In the 1950's, Lady Hyder brought the artisans to Hyderabad and promoted this craft, under the Cottage Industries division in the Nizam’s government.
Over the last few decades, Nirmal work has been evolving in order to cater to new demands from the customers. There has been a transition from the painters of the epics to painting motifs in the old Indian school style. The Moghul miniatures are also crafted on soft white wood, called Puniki and these are eventually painted. The technique involves application of luppam on wood surface and then painting the precise design. The colors used in Nirmal paintings are mostly the familiar gold color. The paintings make use of organic colors produced naturally from the extracts of herbs, vegetable dye, gum, and minerals etc. The paintings depict scenes ranging from the grace of a dancer or a musician’s rhythm to birds, panoramic nature settings, and they fully captivate the attention of the viewer.
First the wood is cut into required size and a rectangular frame is made. The frame is smoothened using sand paper. The frame is also coated with several coats of luppam paint. Luppam Paint (NC patti) is coated on the rectangular shaped wood board for about 5 to 6 times. This paint absorbs the moisture from the wood and helps the wood to last for many years. After applying luppam paint, various colors are used for painting the background. Finally, the prepared wooden plank is joined to the frame. Usually, the board sizes are of 8/11, 17/11 and 24/16 dimensions.
The process in which Nirmal painting is done varies slightly from making toys. In this process, initially lacquering of the wood surface is done followed by painting according to the precise design. After painting, the plaque is given a coat of Duco paint using the desired background color. In earlier days, white wood of Tella Poniki tree was used as paint board for painting, which is fascinatingly outstanding. With changes over many years, the artisans introduced Indian teak wood due to its soft grain texture, strength, and lightweight and lifetime quality. Traditional designs are traced or drawn in chalk on smoothened wood or composition board and are painted in flat, bright colors and often touched up with gold and then varnished. Once the paintings are completed, clear spray is used on the frames for water resistance and luster. The Nirmal painting of Mughal miniatures is highly attractive. With aging, they acquire a special muted glow that is considered impeccable.
Nirmal town has become synonymous with exquisite painting all over the world and is a matter of pride for Telangana. Nirmal craftsmen also create lacquered furniture, boxes, bowls, large screens, trays, toys, and pictures, which are painted with finesse and attention to detail. Frames, shields and corporate gifts, name plates, Utility items constitute the range of products. There are paintings done even on the door, wall decoration etc. The paintings are gifted as souvenirs and are considered as proud possessions by lovers of art and art collectors. Painters and artists from all over India visit Nirmal to not only buy these masterpieces but also research the methodology in which the paintings are done, right from preparation of the canvass to the extraction of organic colors and style of painting.
Nirmal paintings are popular for many decades and the government of Telangana is making all efforts for promoting a global identity for the one-of- its-kind Nirmal Paintings and art works. The paintings are also exported to Australia, USA and UK through Golkonda handicrafts emporia (TS Govt Undertaking).

Cheriyal Scroll Paintings
This art form is unique to the state of Telangana and made mostly in Hyderabad currently.
Cheriyal Scroll Painting is a popular and modified version of Nakashi art, considered highly rich in the local motifs. This art form is unique to the state of Telangana and made mostly in Hyderabad currently.
These scrolls are painted in narrative format similar to a film roll or even comic strips, and depict stories from the Indian mythology as well as the shorter stories related to the Puranas and Epics. Scroll paintings are known for their rich history and they also assume a significant role among Asia’s artistic traditions. The Cheriyal paintings represent a distinct local invention, based mainly on local traditions.
The Nakashis are the artists of Telangana and the scrolls constitute a key element of the social and cultural setting of Telangana. These paintings were mostly confined to Cheriyal village, and hence called Cheriyal scrolls. The scrolls earlier depicted the adventures and the exploits of local folk heroes wherein each community had its popular heroes. This traditional art form is considered an inseparable part of the profession comprising the story-telling and balladeer community called Kaki Padagollu. They have displayed these scrolls which are also accompanied by music and dance. The scrolls would be flowing like a film roll, which is usually nearly three feet in width and about 40 to 45 feet in length, based on the story.
The traditional scrolls are mostly of vertical format and illustrate the stories through a series of horizontal panels. Here, there is a floral border in the middle separating the two panels, and the linear narrative is shown, being held with both hands or suspended from a tree. It is further rolled continually. Compared to the long scrolls in the past, now artists have adapted to paint smaller versions of these scrolls that only depict any single episode or few characters from the traditional stories. These can be framed easily and hung on walls of modern homes.
The canvas making is an elaborate procedure. It is made of Khadi cotton, starch, white mud and a paste of tamarind seeds and gum water. After the canvas is complete, the artists prepare the outline directly using a brush on the canvas. These outlines are defined clearly and appear sharp which shows the quality as well as the skill of the Cheriyal craftsman. At present, the Cheriyal painting work is being continued by some selected families. There are only few artists remaining who still paint, making use of this unique technique. One of the recent innovations is the painting of single pictures instead of a continuous scroll for the purpose of wall decorations.
Cheriyal Painting is easily recognized by certain unique characteristics: These are painted in vivid hues with mostly primary colors, showing a predominance of red color in the background. These paintings are characterized by unbridled imaginations of the local artisans. In this form of art, the iconography of major deities like Vishnu, Shiva, etc. too carry a strong local idiom. The subjects of the scroll paintings are mostly drawn from mythological, ancient literary and folk traditions. The major themes are Krishna Leela, Mahabharata, Ramayana, Shiva Puranam, Markandey Puranam along with the ballads and folk stories of Gauda, Madiga and other communities. The main narrative involves scenes from the common rural life such as women performing kitchen chores, men working in fields or experiencing merry, festival settings, etc. The costumes and settings reflect the culture of Telangana.
Cheriyal Painting is widely popular due to the unique rural element which renders an aura of exclusivity and charm for the art items. It represents the pride of Telangana, especially the region’s tryst with such rare and unique art forms. Cheriyal scroll painting also received Intellectual Property Rights Protection, commonly called the Geographical Indication (GI) tag in the year 2007. It is a matter of academic interest for painters all over India and the world, who study the art work with attention to detail and efforts are on to preserve this rich tradition for posterity by actively promoting the tradition of Cheriyal Painting.

Sri Kurumurthy Swamy Jathara - Mahabubnagar
This 630 years old temple built in 1350 AD is located on Kurupathi Hills in Ammapur village, Mahbubnagar.
Sri Kurumurthy Srinivas Swamy Temple, considered as one of the oldest temples in Telangana is a major attraction to the devotees of Lord Vishnu, else known as Lord Venkateshwara. The temple is known for its spiritual history and the traditions being followed here.
The existence of the temple on the hills is associated with the story of Goddess Sri Lakshmi Devi asking Lord Srinivasa to make His presence felt on the hills so the devotees are able to offer the prayers to the Almighty. So to please the Goddess, Lord manifested himself on the Kurupathi Hills.
The name Kurupathi refers to three words in Telugu dialect, ‘Kuru’ means ‘to do’, ‘Matim’ referring to ‘mind’ and ‘pati’ meaning ‘husband’. Hence this refers to the place where the Lord resides. The image of the Lord had been in the caves for almost 630 years till Sri Mukkara Chandra Reddy constructed a temple in the hills and placed the image there. The temple was further renovated by Sri Ramabhupal and KothaKapulu.
The temple has been built in a magnificent architectural style. The entrance has a huge Gopuram. There are 200 steps leading to the main temple, though the pilgrims can also go by their vehicles.

Ramzan
The biggest congregation is witnessed at historic Mecca Masjid near Charminar.
Ramzan is the ninth month as per the Islamic Lunar calendar. Ramadan/Ramzan begins after the month of Shaban, when the new moon is sighted. In case new moon is not seen after 30 days of Shaban, then Ramadan begins. The month of Ramzan lasts for 29 or 30 days based on the sighting of the moon. If the moon is sighted during the night of 29th fast, then the month of Shawwal begins next day and Ramadan is over. The first of Shawwal is the Eid called Eid-ul-fitr for distinguishing this from Eid-ul-azha (Bakri Eid).
Ramzan is believed to be the month in which the Quran was revealed and involves fasting done by all able-bodied men including women and children who have reached puberty. During Ramzan, the people who fast donot eat or drink right from dawn to after sunset. Eid al-Fitr is a holiday in Telangana, which celebrates the end of Ramadan and marks the first day of the Islamic month of Shawwal.
The Muslim holy month of Ramadan is observed with fervor by Muslim brethren in Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana. Sirens blare in unison from hundreds of mosques across the city for ‘sahr’ which is also the pre-dawn meals. The Muslim-majority in old city and other neighborhoods of Hyderabad become abuzz with activity while thousands throng the mosques for the purpose of ‘Namaz-e-Taraveeh’ or the special prayers offered daily during when priests recite Holy Quran.
The biggest congregation is witnessed at historic Mecca Masjid near Charminar. Special arrangements are made at many mosques and function halls for women folk to offer their prayers. Shopping for groceries and other items during this month continues until late night.
The historic city of Hyderabad with a rich Muslim heritage comes vibrantly alive during this holy month. Most of the hotels sell lip-smacking Haleem, a dish cherished by people after ‘Iftar’ or breaking the day’s fast. Tonnes of dates and fruits are sold every day to break the fast. Ramzan is a time of immense festivities, where the popular Hindu-Muslim unity comes alive in Telangana, which is a cradle of secularism

Peerla Panduga
Muharram, also called Peerla Panduga is an important festival in the state of Telangana
Muharram, also called Peerla Panduga is an important festival in the state of Telangana. Muharram is a festival marked by processions. During this occasion, a relic called Alam is taken out as a procession. Ashurkhana, representing a group of Sufi Shrines, is the area where the procession takes place, Many Muslims and even Hindus take part in this festival by chanting Ya Hussain as they participate eagerly in this procession.
In Dabeerpura area of Hyderabad, Hindus are considered alambardaar, which means standard-bearers at the famous shrine of Bibi Ka Alawa. Hindus throng in thousands to worship the holy relic of Alam since it is believed that a darshan of this Alam gives them solace and peace of mind. On this special day of Muharram, Hindus visit Sufi shrines. Peerla Panduga is actually an occasion of sorrow when the Hindu devotees respect the sentiments of their Islamic brothers and and participate in a solemn procession.
The deities are brought from the forest to a spot for a period of 10-12 days when more than one crore devotees offer prayers and gift ‘bangaram’, which is pure jaggery to the deities. The entire place reverberates with divine chants and elaborate arrangements are made for this Jathara with thousands of buses arriving with pilgrims.
The Badeshahi Ashurkhana in Hyderabad has a rich 400-year old history and is also home to the maximum crowds during this festival. Thousands of Hindus visit this shrine, especially during the 9th and 10th day of the festival. Several foreign tourists also witness the proceedings of these festivities. The final day involves Alam being carried on top of an elephant as a procession from Bibi ka Alawa towards Masjid-e-Ilahi. The festival is also celebrated in many rural regions of Telangana close to Sufi shrines or Durgahs.

Yadagirigutta
Sri Lakshminarasimha Swamy Temple or Yadagirigutta is a popular Hindu Temple devoted to Lord Narasimha Swamy, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. It is situated over a hillock in the Nalgonda district, Telangana at a distance of 6 km from Riagir Railway station, 13 km from Bhongir and around 60 kilometers from the capital city of Hyderabad.

The place witnesses a heavy rush of devotees, not less than 5000-8000 pilgrims on average each day for offering their vows, performing pujas, kalyanam, abhisekam etc. while the crowd grows substantially during weekends, holidays and festivals.
According to legend in Tretayugam, there was a sage called Yadarishi, who was son of the great sage Rishyasrunga and Santa Devi and performed penance inside a cave with Anjaneya's blessings. Pleased with his devotion Lord Narasimha reportedly appeared before him in five different forms namely Sri Jwala Narasimha , SriGandabherunda, Sri Yogananda, Sri Ugra and Sri Lakshminarasimha which later manifested into finely sculpted forms and hence it is worshiped as Pancha Narasimha Kshetram. According to Skanda Purana, there is a cave temple of Lord Vishnu where several years ago the invincible Sudharshna chakra moved in the direction like a compass guiding them towards this temple. Here Aaradhana and Puja are performed as per Pancharatra Agamam. The puja vidhanam here is done as prescribed by Late Sri Vangeepuram Narasimhacharyulu who had served as Sthanacharya of this famous temple. In 15th Century, the Vijayanagara king Sri Krishnadevarayalu had mentioned about the temple in autobiography that before going to war he always visited the temple praying the lord for victory. The temple town has facilities for accommodation of pilgrims while many tonsure their heads after fulfillment of a wish. The town is well connected by a ghat road to the capital and nearby key towns. There are many restaurants here for the sake of devotees while the devasthanam board continues to make other amenities available for the public including special darshan, kalyanam, providing prasadams etc. The temple is highly revered in the Telangana region.

Ananthagiri Hills Anantha Padmanabha Swamy Temple
One of the Hindu temples called the Sri Anantha Padmanabha Swamy temple is located in the beautiful hilly region of the Ananthagiri hills in Vikarabad, Rangareddy district of Telangana, India. This temple on Ananthagiri hills is dedicated to worship Lord Vishnu. Sri Nalapur Sitaram is the head priest of this temple. According to Hindu Mythology, Skanda Purana, it is believed that this Sri Anantha Padmanabha Swamy temple was constructed by the rishi Markandeya in the dwapara yuga on Ananthagiri hills. The rishi Markandeya came here for yoga sadhana every day because the splendid and pleasant atmosphere of Ananthagiri hills attracted him. After his Yoga and meditation, Rishi Markandeya used to go to Kasi to take a holy bath in the river Ganges through a cave. During the dwadasi season, Markandeya couldn't make it to Kasi in the early hours of the day. He was very upset with this and after seeing the rishi's concerns, Lord Vishnu himself appeared in Markandeya's dreams and arranged water from the river Ganges for the rishi's bath. Markandeya was blessed to take a permanent place in the world as a river by lord Krishna who disguised himself as Sri Anantha Padmanabha Swamy. This river which is now popularly known as the river Moosi flows through Hyderabad. Markandeya initially took dharshanam of Sri Anantha Padmanabha Swamy and converted a charka into Swamy. It is said that for the past four hundred years the Nizam Nawabs visited Ananthagiri hills for its peaceful atmosphere and would rest there. The main temple of Lord Padmanabha Swamy was built by the Hyderabad Nawab as Sri Anantha Padmanabha Swamy appeared in his dreams and asked him to build a temple for him. This temple is situated in the village of Ananthagiri at a distance of seventy-five kilometers from Hyderabad and five kilometers from Vikarabad. There are regular private transport operators and frequent buses between Vikarabad and Ananthagiri hills.

Bhadrakali Temple

One such ancient construction that reveals our history is the Bhadrakali Temple in Warangal. The temple which is counted as one of the oldest temples of Indian History is dedicated to the worship the mother of goddesses, Kali Matha or Bhadrakali Ammavaru. Goddess Bhadrakali is a true example of the capability and strength of women. Surrounded by the lush greenery amidst the hilly region, the Bhadrakali Temple opens up to a picturesque setting on the banks of the Bhadrakali Lake. The serene surroundings of the temple work as an add-on and help the mind to relax and soothe the soul, while one gives away in obedience to the supreme power.
The history behind the temple dates back to 625AD. It is believed that the Chalukya King Pulekesi II after successfully bringing the Vengi region of Telangana under his dominion, constructed a magnificent temple dedicated to the mother goddess to celebrate his victory and also express his dedication and gratitude to goddess Bhadrakali for granting him his competence. We can see the style of the great Chalukya Dynasty in every bit of the temple, right from its architecture to the main deity, which displays the Ekanda Shila or single stone sculpture, which makes as the trademark style attributed to the Chalukyas. One can also observe the strong resemblance to the Kakatiya style of architecture in the temple, particularly the entrance gateways which are made of stone.

Sanghi Temple
The Sanghi temple is one of the most famous temples in Hyderabad. It is a very beautiful temple done in marble and the management has given a lot of importance to the environment. You can see this first hand as there are many trees and vegetation in and around the temple. Many Telugu films have been shot in this temple.
The stretch of the road to reach the temple is quiet good with a neatly laid two lane black tar road along the way with trees paving the path. The road to Sanghi gives an impression of a ghat road. And when you go further, a Hanuman Temple welcomes you. After the darshan, you can look on to a beautiful view of the city from the hilltop. The main deity here is Venkateshwara Swamy. The temple also houses Padmavati Devi. There are Navagrahas in the temple premises.
This enchanting Temple is located in Sanghi Nagar, some 25 kilometers from Hyderabad. It takes its position on a hillock known as the Paramananda Giri. The Raja Gopuram is 15 feet tall, and can be seen from several kilometers away. A little further in the premises, a long flight of carpet covered steps leads to the entrance of the temple. The first thing that catches your eye is the heavy, beautifully carved door that forms the main entrance. The majestic temple is built in the flawless Chola-Chalukya style of architecture. You can find three Gopurams at the foot of the hillock, which stand tall as if entering into the heavens.

Maisigandi Maisamma Temple
Maisigandi Maisamma Temple located in Mahabubnagar district is a revered shrine that offers spirituality amid beautiful and green pastures. According to the legend, a cowherd was on his way to the forest when he saw an idol of Ammavaru in the green pastures. He then reportedly rushed to the village and informed everyone about the idol of Ammavaru. The villagers were extremely happy to find that the revered Goddess decided to bless them in the form of the idol and started worshiping the idol.
The Mahakaali temple here is undergoing rapid development, and it has also become a must-see temple, which represents the cultural and mythological leanings of the local Banjara people.

Karmanghat Hanuman Temple
The Karmanghat Hanuman Temple is a very popular temple located at Karmanghat, on the way to Sagar road. This temple, dedicated to the Pawan Putra Hanuman, the greatest devotee of Lord Shri Ram is one of the oldest temples in the state capital, Hyderabad.
History of the Karmanghat Hanuman Temple:
This famous temple in Karmanghat was constructed in the 12th century A.D. according to the legend, when a Kakatiya ruler who was hunting after some time in the forest, felt tired and sat down to take rest under a tree. While resting, the king heard someone chanting the name of Lord Rama, the king got interested and went around trying to find who it was and as he walked further deep into the forest, he discovered an idol of Lord Hanuman. The stone idol was in a sitting posture and the voice was coming from within the vigraham. Having paid his respects, the humble king returned to his capital, and that very night, Lord Hanuman appeared in his dream and asked the king to construct a temple.
The Karmanghat Temple was constructed immediately and the succeeding kings of the Kakatiya dynasty ruled it well. Some 400 years later, Aurangzeb had ordered his armies to each and every corner of the country to destroy all Hindus temples. At this temple, Aurangazeb's mighty armies could not even enter near the compound wall. After learning this, Aurangzeb, himself went there to wipe out the temple with a with a crow bar in his hand. When he reached the temple premises, he heard a deafening roar rumbling and the instrument slipped from his hands as fear overwhelmed him. Then he heard a thundering voice from the heavens saying Mandir todna hai raja, to kar maan ghat" which means, oh king, if you want to destroy this temple, then make your heart strong. The place got its name kar-man-ghat, after the voice from the heavens. And to this day, the main deity Lord Anjaneya sits in the temple peacefully meditating and bestows his blessing to his devotees, as Dhyana Anjaneya Swamy.

Chilkur Balaji Temple
Our country is an incredible land, and a home for amazing cultural integration. People in India are briskly embracing technology, but deep inside, they are still rooted to their faith in god. Indians, of all age groups embark on a path of spiritual journey in the name of God and faith. One such temple standing high is the Chilkur Balaji Temple. The amazing deity of this temple is also known as VISA God. This name comes as a surprise for many but some people come to the temple with a belief that Chilkur Balaji is very powerful in helping people secure foreign VISAs.
This temple is located on the outskirts of the state capital, on the banks of the Osman Sagar Lake. The temple is definitely an epicenter of a great deal of spiritual energy. According to the history of this temple, almost all the IT professionals who visit the temple had received an opportunity to fly abroad within a year. The faith here is that if a you make a wish after 11 pradakshanas, then that wish comes true. And once the wish comes true, you will have to come back to do 108 pradakshanas around the entire temple.
Even the popular Wall Street Journal, amused with the belief, has written a full article on this temple. People from all sects visit this temple in hope of getting their wishes fulfilled. Another notable aspect of this temple is that it is one of the very few temples in the country, which does not accept any monetary donations in the Hundi. The management believes that the only fee the lord asks the devotees to make pradakshanas around the temple. It is a matter of sheer pride that our nation holds such rich heritage where beliefs and faiths in good are passed on from one generation to the other with or without any scriptures.

Constructed in the 14th century the Dichpally Ramalayam, which is also called the Khilla Ramayanam is one of the oldest and most known temples in Nizamabad. The temple is dedicated to Lord Rama, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu. It is believed to have been built by the generous Kakatiya kings. As the temple has a lot of resemblance in its style and structure, it is also called the Indhoor Khajuraho or the Khajuraho of Nizamabad.
To get to this holy place, one has to travel a distance of 27 Kms from Nizamabad on the way to Hyderabad. The Dichpally Ramalayam temple is one of the finest examples of the ancient stone architecture. It was built in white and black Basalt stone, and is embellished with idols of goddesses, devils, animals, and also has Khajuraho style erotic structures engraved on each of its pillars, ceilings and door frames. Each year, during the monsoon season, the surrounding area of the temple is filled with water and at this time of the year, the temple assumes the look of an island.
The Ramalayam has 105 steps which the visitors have to walk in order to offer prayers to the deity. For the convenience of old and challenged people, the temple also has a pedestrian subway. The subway is also the common connecting link with the Raghunanda Temple. Each carving on the walls inside and outside of the temple stand as strong reminders of the Kakatiya glory.

Keesaragutta Temple
The Keesaragutta Temple is a Hindu shrine dedicated to Lord Siva and his consorts Goddesses Bhavani and Sivadurga. The temple takes its seat at Keesaragutta in the Rangareddy district. The town is about 40 kilometers from Hyderabad and 10 kilometers from ECIL. The temple takes its authority on a small hill. It attracts scores of devotees on the day of Shivaratri.
History of Keesaragutta Temple:
Legend has it that Lord Sri Rama installed the Siva lingam in the revered shrine of Keesaragutta to atone for the sin of killing Ravanasura. Lord Rama chose this lovely valley with green pastures surrounded by magnificent hills and ordered Hanuman to bring the Sivalingam all the way from Varanasi, but Hanuman could not arrive on time and as the auspicious hour was approaching, the Lord Siva himself appeared before Rama and presented him a Sivalingam for installation. For this reason, the Shiva lingam in this temple is called Swayambhu Linga. The lingam is also called Ramalingeswara as it was installed by Lord Sri Rama.
Hanuman came with 101 lingams for choice from Varanasi and felt aggrieved at not having his lingam installed. Thus, he threw all over the area. Even to this day, many lingams are also found scattered outside the temple.

Basara
India, also considered as the land of temples has a unique legend associated with each of its temples which lends a mythical charm for them. One such temple in India is that of Gnana Saraswathi at Basar which holds a prominent place. Basar is located on the banks of Godavari River, 34 km from the district headquarters of Nizamabad, very close to Maharashtra border in the North Telangana region.
This temple is an abode of Goddess Saraswathi, Goddess Lakshmi and Kali considered as the Holy Trinity. Legends says that Veda Vyasa, his followers and sage Suka had desired to stay at in a serene environment after the Kurukshetra War. Searching for a peaceful abode, they then moved into the Dandakaranya forest and finally chose this place owing to peaceful climate. Maharishi Vyasa was known for performing his regular ablutions in the Godavari river. Each day after this process he used to get sand in fists and made them into images of Goddess Saraswathi, Lakshmi and Kali by means of his mystic power and offered prayers. The place derives its name from Vyasa and called Vasar or Basar (Basara in local dialect). It is also considered to be among the three temples created near the holy confluence of the Manjira and Godavari Rivers by the Ashtrakutas. A Karnataka king by the name Bijialudu reportedly constructed the current temple at Basar.
Basar is an ideal destination for performing "Akshara Abhyasam" where children perform a ceremonial start before starting formal school education. The Puja begins at the temple daily at 4 am while Alankarana starts at 5 am in a pious atmosphere. The temple is flocked by devotees all round the year especially during Maha Shivaratri, Devi Navarathrulu. The temple can be reached by bus and train from Hyderabad (205 km away) and Nizamabad.

Veerabhadra Swamy Temple
The Sri Veerabhadra Swamy temple is in Bonthapally village, Jinnaram mandal of Medak, Telangana. The temple is also called Bonthapally Temple. It is about 40 kilometer from the state capital, Hyderabad. Several devotees from Hyderabad throng this Sri Veerabhadra Swamy Temple in large numbers during the Sravana masam.
As per the legend, many years ago the village housed only a small temple of Sri Veerabhadra Swamy. One night a shepherd walked past the temple and turned around after hearing something. The shepherd was shocked to see Lord Veerabhadra Swamy, who told him that he did not like the location of the temple and wanted it to be shifted. The God reportedly asked the shepherd to carry him on his shoulder to another location till he gets tired. Then the shepherd carried the lord to Bonthapally. After reaching this village, God reportedly asked the shepherd to go back home without turning back or he would become a statue. However, the shepherd did turn back and became a statue. This statue remains there in the village.

Kethaki Sangameshwara Swamy is one of the old Shiva temples situated at Jharasangam village and Mandal, Medak district. It is said that the Shiva lingam was consecrated by "Lord Bramha ". The king of Surya Vamsha Raja Kupendra during "krutha yug" suffered from a skin disease which did not have a remedy back then. One day while in forest for hunting he reached Kethaki Vanam where he found a stream and washed his body, he was surprised to see his body cleansed and the same night Lord Shiva showed up in his dreams and asked him that he wanted the king to construct a sanatorium on the Shiva lingam. Raja Kupendra constructed a temple and dedicated it to Lord Shiva to show his gratitude. Pushkarni (holy pond) which came to be known as "astha theertha amrutha gundam" and is called as "Dakshina Kasi". Gundam pooja is performed by followers from Karnataka, Maharashtra and Telangana due to its religious and historical importance and pay homage to the Lord Shiva.

Medak Church
In the Medak town, is the famous Cathedral that was built with love and crafted to utmost perfection. According to the legend, this church was the baby of a famine that struck the district during First World War. Charles Walker was posted as the Reverend at Medak at that time. Walker who was moved by the predicament of the people because of the unprecedented famine which lasted for three years, proposed the construction of a great church at Medak district in the year 1914. This beautiful piece of excellence took ten continuous years to take shape. The church has massive dimensions and is very spacious. It can accommodate as many as 5000 people.
The huge widows adorning the high walls of the church are done in a remarkable stained glass. They provide a spectacular view during daytime. No artificial light can re-create this magical scene. This is also the most fascinating feature that attracts scores of people to the church. For people who cannot read, the church serves as a picture book on the holy Bible.
The window to the north of the church offers a canopy to the altar. This view is very fascinating. The scene reprises the assertion of Jesus towering above the altar, shrinking everything as Jesus ascends to heaven. The tiles of the historic church were imported from Italy and the roof has been cast to guarantee best acoustics. With its sheer size and beauty, this century-old Medak church stands out as one of the finest demonstrations of Gothic architecture in the country.

Pembarthi Brass
The intricate sheet metal brass engravings and artefacts made here can be traced back to more than 800 years.
Pembarthi Metal Craft is a popular metal handicraft made in Pembarthi of Warangal district, Telangana State, which is widely known for the exquisite sheet metal art works. The intricate sheet metal brass engravings and artefacts made here can be traced back to more than 800 years.
Pembarthi is a village situated about 80 km from Hyderabad. The region has witnessed glory during the period of the Kakatiya dynasty which had spanned 500 years. Pembarthi has a rich history of outstanding workmanship of the Metal workers or the “Vishwakarmas”.
Therefore, the process of Sheet metal workmanship became popular as it adorned the vigrahas (statues) as well as vahanas (chariots) of several Hindu temples. With great patronage accorded to temples in Kakatiya kingdom, the Pembarthy sheet metal work attracted attention from all over the country.
Since most of the ancient temples in Telangana region were built under the patronage of the Kakatiya rulers, these temples bear the signature style of Pembarthi craftsmen. The metal craft reached the pinnacle of perfection following the higher degree of skills that were displayed by the master craftsmen. The Vishwakaramas of the region were renowned for their rare skills in this form of metal sculpture.It is also known popularly as the Pembarti Brassware. It has become an essential artefact in every handiwork exhibition and has also become synonymous with Telangana’s artistic heritage.
After the advent of Muslim rule, Pembarti craftsmen subsequently evolved their art style and decorated individual items such as betel nut cases or paandaans, perfume containers or Ittar pots, hanging metal Chandeliers or Jhummars, vases, special plaques and mementos.
The skill survived the setbacks of political conditions while the post-independence era has witnessed resurgence of this art that reoriented according to the changed demand patterns. There has been more emphasis on the utilitarian aspect in addition to the exotic. Pembarthi Brassware, over the years has captured the essential nuances of both Hindu and Muslim influences, which has seamlessly blended into both cultures. The craft form has received the prestigious Geographical Indication, which is indeed an honour for the craft.

Festivals of Telangana :: Visit Telangana - Official Tourism Information for Telangana
Bathukamma
Bathukamma celebrates the inherent relationship between earth, water and the human beings.
The unique festival of flowers in Telangana
Bathukamma comes during the latter half of monsoon, before the onset of winter. The monsoon rains usually brings plenty of water into the fresh water ponds of Telangana and it is also the time when wild flowers bloom in various vibrant colors all across the uncultivated and barren plains of the region. The most abundant of these are the ‘gunuka poolu’ and ‘tangedu poolu’. There are other flowers too like the banti, chemanti, nandi-vardhanam etc. Bathukamma is celebrated by the women folk of Telangana, heralding the beauty of nature in vibrant colors of multitudinous flowers.
The festival begins a week before the grand ‘Saddula Bathukamma’ (the grand finale of the Bathukamma festival) which falls two days before Dussehra. The women folk normally get back to their parent's home from their in-laws and breathe the fresh air of freedom to celebrate the colors of flowers. For one complete week, they make small ‘Bathukammas’, play around them every evening and immerse them in a nearby water pond. On the last day, the men folk of the house go into the wild plains and gather the flowers like gunuka and tangedi. They bring home bagfuls of these flowers and the entire household sits down to make the big ‘Bathukamma’. The flowers are carefully arranged row after row in a brass plate (called taambalam) in circular rows and in alternate colors. As evening approaches the women folk dress colourfully with the best of their attire and adorn lot of ornaments and place the Bathukamma in their courtyard. The women of neighborhood also gather in a large circle around it. They start singing songs by circling it repeatedly, building a beautiful human circle of unity, love, sisterhood.
After playing in circles around the “Bathukammalu”, before the onset of dusk, the women folk carry them on their heads and move as a procession towards a bigger water body near the village or town. The procession is extremely colourful with the decorations of women and the “Bathukammalu”. Songs of folklore are sung in chorus throughout the procession and the streets resonate with them. Finally, when they reach the water pond the “Bathukammalu” are slowly immersed into water after some more playing and singing. Then they share the ‘maleeda’ (a dessert made with sugar or raw sugar and corn bread) sweets amongst the family members and neighborhood folks. They return to their homes with empty ‘taambaalam’ singing songs in praise of Bathukamma. The songs of Bathukamma echo in the streets until late night during the entire week..
Bathukamma celebrates the inherent relationship between earth, water and the human beings. During the entire preceding week, women make ‘boddemma’ (a deity of Gowri – mother Durga – made with earthly mud) along with Bathukamma and immerse it in the pond. This helps reinforce the ponds and helps it retain more water. The flowers used in Bathukamma have a great quality of purifying water and such flowers when immersed in abundance into the pond have the effect of cleansing the water and making the environment much better. In times where the fresh water ponds are gradually diminishing and dwindling away it is indeed a pride of Telangana that its womenfolk (with mostly agrarian background) inherently know how to make them better by celebrating the beauty of nature. It is something we indeed have to feel proud of. The festival heralds the beauty of nature, collective spirit of Telangana people, the indomitable spirit of women folks and also the scientific approach of the agrarian people towards preserving the resources of nature in a celebrative way. Hence, Bathukamma is the icon of cultural identity of Telangana.

Kaleshwara Mukteswara Swamy Temple
Kaleshwaram is a town lying on the border of Telangana and Maharashtra. The town is popularly known for its ancient and famous Kaleshwara Mukteshwara Swamy Temple. This is a revered temple is dedicated to the worship of the powerful Lord Shiva. The most iconic aspect in this ancient temple is the presence of two Lingams holding on to a single pedestal or the Panavattam. The temple gets its name Kaleshwara Mukteswara Swamy mandiram because of the duel presence of Lord Shiva or the Mukteshwara and the other is the Lord Yama or Kaleshwar.
Karimnagar tourism gains a lot of importance from the historical significance of this temple. It is also believed that the Kaleshwara Mukteswara Swamy temple is one of the three temples of Lord Shiva of Trilinga Desham. All the three temples are considered as Jyotirlingas that ornament the three corners of Telugu Land. The other two temples constituting the Trilinga Desam are at the Draksharamam and Srisailam. The Karimnagar temple boasts of several unique features, one of which is the hole in the Mukteshwara linga which can never be filled with water. The reason behind it is still a wonder. Many researchers have failed to provide any explanation for this. However, there are a few indications of a possible underground passage which goes all the way to the River Godavari which could provide a logical explanation. Another special attraction of this temple is the interesting sculpture of the fish idol.

Bhadrachalam
Bhadrachalam is a key town of Pilgrimage importance located in the Khammam District of Telangana. The temple town of Bhadrachalam is situated on the banks of Godavari River. It was part of East Godavari District, Andhra Pradesh till 1959. The town is synonymous for its famous temple devoted to Lord Rama. Bhadrachalam Revenue division is considered one of the largest revenue divisions in the country, which was transferred to Khammam district of Telangana region for administrative purposes.
According to history, Paleolithic man had roamed the areas, which is called the lower Godavari valley that includes Bhadrachalam and its surroundings. Bhadrachalam town has a clearly documented history of Lord Sri Rama temple, which was constructed in the 17th Century CE. According to Mythology, the present town was once part of the Dandakaranya forest, which Lord Sri Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had visited during their exile also called vanavasam according to local parlance. The jungle which is now in the vicinity of temple was the place for Rama’s retreat and a place called Parnasala which is 32 km away was the location where Rama had built a dwelling for himself and Sita. It was here that Sita was abducted by Lanka ruler, Ravana.
The town shares its historical significance with Ramayana Era. The name Bhadrachalam is derived from the word Bhadragiri (The Mountain Abode of Bhadra, the child of Meru and Menaka). The famous temple at Bhadrachalam is home to the Archa Murthy’s of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana and their idols are believed to be swayambhu i.e. self-manifested ones.
Bhadrachalam division also has several other Hindu temples. Parnasala is believed to be the spot where Rama constructed a hermitage during his exile and spent time with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana. Agastya muni helped Rama select this spot. For the purpose of tourists, there is picturesque display of few scenes from vanavasa at Parnasala. Pilgrims enthrall when they see the footprints of Sita devi, the mosaic of Maarecha who appears in the guise of golden deer and Ravana who appears in the form of Sanyasi for Bhikshatana. One can see Sita Vaagu where Sita had bathed and gathered turmeric and Kunkum from the nearby stones. Yetapaka located 2 km from Bhadrachalam has a history where the bird Jatayuvu, an ardent devotee of Rama tried to obstruct Ravana when he was proceeding on a chariot after kidnapping Sita. A fierce batted ensued and a wing of the bird was believed to have found at Rekkapalli.
Rama is worshipped as Atmarama here at Dummugudem where according to Purana, Rama killed around 14,000 demons belonging to Khara and Dushana. The place is called Dummugudem as it was built on the ashes of these demons. At Gundala, located 5 km away from Bhadrachalam, once can see hot water springs after digging a pit on the riverbank and it is said that the divine trio of Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwara dipped in the holy water here during winter season. There are other places too like Sree Rama Giri, Venkatreddipeta, Gannavaram etc. The temple town witnesses heavy influx of pilgrims during Sree Rama Kalyanam. Kothagudem, 40 kilometers away is the nearest railway station and regular buses are available from here, Khammam, Hyderabad and Vijayawada.

Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple Nampally Gutta
Just 2 kilometers away from the town of Vemulawada is an interesting temple, at Nampally Gutta. It is the Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy aalayam. The temple is nestled on a small hillock on the highway connecting Vemulawada and Karimnagar. The powerful Lord Narasimha Swamy adorns the hills. You can observe this with most of the temples for the revered Lord Narasimha that are usually located on hills. The Manpally Gutta temple also adheres to the same tradition.
Vehicles are only restricted to a certain point on the hill from where the tourists have to walk a few hundred steps that lead to the top. The climb up to the temple may be strenuous as it is slightly steep. When you reach the top of the hill, you will reach this small temple dedicated to Lord Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy.
The little temple doesn't look like an ancient one, and is attached to a huge rock, which indicates to a probable idol, that was carved out of the rock, around which the temple was built. At the entrance of the temple, you can find a statue of Lord Narasimha breaking his way out of a pillar.

Kaleshwara Mukteswara Swamy Temple
Kaleshwaram is a town lying on the border of Telangana and Maharashtra. The town is popularly known for its ancient and famous Kaleshwara Mukteshwara Swamy Temple. This is a revered temple is dedicated to the worship of the powerful Lord Shiva. The most iconic aspect in this ancient temple is the presence of two Lingams holding on to a single pedestal or the Panavattam. The temple gets its name Kaleshwara Mukteswara Swamy mandiram because of the duel presence of Lord Shiva or the Mukteshwara and the other is the Lord Yama or Kaleshwar.
Karimnagar tourism gains a lot of importance from the historical significance of this temple. It is also believed that the Kaleshwara Mukteswara Swamy temple is one of the three temples of Lord Shiva of Trilinga Desham. All the three temples are considered as Jyotirlingas that ornament the three corners of Telugu Land. The other two temples constituting the Trilinga Desam are at the Draksharamam and Srisailam. The Karimnagar temple boasts of several unique features, one of which is the hole in the Mukteshwara linga which can never be filled with water. The reason behind it is still a wonder. Many researchers have failed to provide any explanation for this. However, there are a few indications of a possible underground passage which goes all the way to the River Godavari which could provide a logical explanation. Another special attraction of this temple is the interesting sculpture of the fish idol.

Yadagirigutta
Sri Lakshminarasimha Swamy Temple or Yadagirigutta is a popular Hindu Temple devoted to Lord Narasimha Swamy, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. It is situated over a hillock in the Nalgonda district, Telangana at a distance of 6 km from Riagir Railway station, 13 km from Bhongir and around 60 kilometers from the capital city of Hyderabad.
Yadagirigutta is a unique and pleasant hillock that enjoys moderate climate in all seasons. The place witnesses a heavy rush of devotees, not less than 5000-8000 pilgrims on average each day for offering their vows, performing pujas, kalyanam, abhisekam etc. while the crowd grows substantially during weekends, holidays and festivals.
According to legend in Tretayugam, there was a sage called Yadarishi, who was son of the great sage Rishyasrunga and Santa Devi and performed penance inside a cave with Anjaneya's blessings. Pleased with his devotion Lord Narasimha reportedly appeared before him in five different forms namely Sri Jwala Narasimha , SriGandabherunda, Sri Yogananda, Sri Ugra and Sri Lakshminarasimha which later manifested into finely sculpted forms and hence it is worshiped as Pancha Narasimha Kshetram. According to Skanda Purana, there is a cave temple of Lord Vishnu where several years ago the invincible Sudharshna chakra moved in the direction like a compass guiding them towards this temple. Here Aaradhana and Puja are performed as per Pancharatra Agamam. The puja vidhanam here is done as prescribed by Late Sri Vangeepuram Narasimhacharyulu who had served as Sthanacharya of this famous temple. In 15th Century, the Vijayanagara king Sri Krishnadevarayalu had mentioned about the temple in autobiography that before going to war he always visited the temple praying the lord for victory. The temple town has facilities for accommodation of pilgrims while many tonsure their heads after fulfillment of a wish. The town is well connected by a ghat road to the capital and nearby key towns. There are many restaurants here for the sake of devotees while the devasthanam board continues to make other amenities available for the public including special darshan, kalyanam, providing prasadams etc. The temple is highly revered in the Telangana region.

Dhulikatta
The Buddhist circuit has a lot of prominent places that spell their glory. One such prominent places of the Buddhists takes nestling in Telangana, in the Karimnagar in a small town called Dhulikatta. The village is only 25 kilometers away from the Karimnagar city. The Buddhist Mahastupa or the great stupa and vihar in Dhulikatta village were established at the end of the 2nd century BC, which is more than 2000 years ago. During that period, the region played a greater role and thus was protected with numerous fortifications. According to many historians, the description of this fortified town which is situated on the banks of a river that has been conceptualized by the Greek emissary Megasthenes, matches with that of this town. The remains and ruins of this ancient stupa that has been built on an elevated place are still discernible. The constructions of platforms make the Mahastupa look larger. The lime-stone blocks that are elegantly carved are decorated with many Buddhist symbols like the Muchalindanaga (a snake from the Buddhist mythology). Several other remnants such as the punched coins from Roman Kingdom and Satvahana dynasty, beads, combs made of ivory, bangles and authentic silver jewellery have been brought to light in the excavations around the Mahastupa in Dhulikatta.

One among the many impressive historical monuments is the very striking Nizamabad Fort of the city, Nizamabad. The Nizamabad Fort was constructed on the top of a small hill located somewhat to the south west of the town, during the 10th century AD. The kings of the ancient dynasty, Rashtraputha, built this amazing citadel during the period of their absolute control over these areas.
The Fort has its head very high with a height of about 300 meters. There are a number of rulers who enjoyed their authority over this awe inspiring construction because of the constant change of the ruling power in the area. So the control of the Fort had been in numerous hands of different rulers from a list of dynasties.
A lot of changes to the fort's architectural design have been made to the fort over a period of several hundred years. Accounting to the religious sites present within the fort confines, the Nizamabad Fort is also known for its historical significance. The fort was originally developed on a temple of Lord Ram. The Sri Ramulavari Temple within the fort compound happens to be rather popular with local people. The temple has vast corridors, mundaps and also the mahamundaps. Another significance is that the temple was actually built by the well known Indian leader Chatrapathi Shivaji.

Nagarjuna Sagar
A site to behold when its gates are opened during peak flood season in Monsoon, Nagarjuna Sagar Dam is considered one of largest dams built in the recent times in Asia. As the tallest masonry dam, Nagarjuna Sagar Dam is also the pride of India. The colossal dam was built for the purpose of water supply and irrigation to Nalgonda and Khammam districts of Telangana. The project has catchment area of roughly 215000 sq.km. The project also boasts of the largest canal system network in India .The mighty dam was completed in the year 1969 and has a majestic height of 124 meters. It is 1 km long, and has 26 crest gates. The dam can store upto 11, 472 million cubic meters of water in the reservoir.
The project commenced in February 1956 and after a brief gap, due to lack of modern equipment it was constructed with stone rather than concrete. Nearby at Macherla a cement factory was constructed to meet the project requirements. The dam was completed fully in 1972 once the crest gates were installed. The dam has two canals, the left and right canals that supply water from the reservoir. The dam is also one of the earliest projects built in post independence India for irrigation and hydro-electricity generation. Exclusively for the purpose of tourism, a lake developed behind the dam, which boasts of its status as the third largest man-made lake anywhere in the world.
A beautiful landscape and strikingly scenic water body adds beauty to the impressive structure. The turbines for power generation are located towards Nalgonda (Telangana) district. The dam derives its name from a nearby hillock and island called Nagarjunakonda, where an ancient Buddhist Guru had once lived. There is a famous and well-maintained museum here that houses ancient artifacts. Apart from the lake where regular boating facilities are provided, tourists can also visit other attractions such as Ethipothala waterfalls, and Srisailam Wildlife Reserve close by. The dam was envisioned to be a temple of modern India, according to India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Apart from meeting drinking water needs, irrigation and power requirements, the dam is an attractive tourist destination owing to the large reservoir, the mighty flow when the crest gates are open present a panoramic view which enthralls tourists.

Parnasala
Parnasala is a small village located at a distance of 32 kilometers from the holy town Bhadrachalam in the state of Telangana, India. A little glitch in reaching the village is its remote location because of which makes it a little difficult to access. One can reach Parnasala only by road or boats as the means of transportation.
According to the legend, the most disciplined Lord Shri Ram spent some of his fourteen years of exile at this place. The little stream stands as a testimony to the belief that Sita, wife of Lord Shri Ram, took her bath in the stream, the place is called Sita Vaagu. Every belief is justified one such proof is the imprints in “Radhagutta” in Parnasala. Another story accounting to the history of this historical village is that Maricha Rakshas was killed by Lord Shri Ram in the same place when he came in disguise as a golden deer to deceive Goddess Sita.
Parnasala, which became a much visited picnic spot in Bhadrachalam is said to be the place where the evil-minded king Ravan abducted Goddess Sita. This place unfolds this part of the epic Ramayana by exhibiting the primary events with beautifully canvassed sculptures of Shri Ram, Sita, Laxman, and Ravan.

Khammam Fort
Located at about 193 kms towards the east of Hyderabad is one of Telangana’s important districts, Khammam. The district is famous for coal reserves in the Telangana region at a region named Singareni. The beautiful town enjoys its habitat on the banks of the river Munneru, which is a tributary of the mighty river Krishna. This city also holds a lot of prominence in the history of the state. The city holds many significant places to visit. One such place is the famous Khammam Fort. The fort holds historical significance not just for the Khammam city, but also for the entire state of Andhra Pradesh.
The majestic fort stands as the pride of our past glories atop a hill. It is a beautifully woven flag of prosperity and is a true example of both bravery and a supreme blend of various styles of architecture. This unique marriage of different architectures stems from the fact the Khammam fort was built by rulers of different religions at diverse times. The fort was constructed in the 950s by the glorious Kakatiya rulers. The kings Velama and Musunuri Nayak were also involved in its construction. Later in 1531, the Qutub Shahi kings developed the Khammam Fort.

Basara
India, also considered as the land of temples has a unique legend associated with each of its temples which lends a mythical charm for them. One such temple in India is that of Gnana Saraswathi at Basar which holds a prominent place. Basar is located on the banks of Godavari River, 34 km from the district headquarters of Nizamabad, very close to Maharashtra border in the North Telangana region.
This temple is an abode of Goddess Saraswathi, Goddess Lakshmi and Kali considered as the Holy Trinity. Legends says that Veda Vyasa, his followers and sage Suka had desired to stay at in a serene environment after the Kurukshetra War. Searching for a peaceful abode, they then moved into the Dandakaranya forest and finally chose this place owing to peaceful climate. Maharishi Vyasa was known for performing his regular ablutions in the Godavari river. Each day after this process he used to get sand in fists and made them into images of Goddess Saraswathi, Lakshmi and Kali by means of his mystic power and offered prayers. The place derives its name from Vyasa and called Vasar or Basar (Basara in local dialect). It is also considered to be among the three temples created near the holy confluence of the Manjira and Godavari Rivers by the Ashtrakutas. A Karnataka king by the name Bijialudu reportedly constructed the current temple at Basar.
Basar is an ideal destination for performing "Akshara Abhyasam" where children perform a ceremonial start before starting formal school education. The Puja begins at the temple daily at 4 am while Alankarana starts at 5 am in a pious atmosphere. The temple is flocked by devotees all round the year especially during Maha Shivaratri, Devi Navarathrulu. The temple can be reached by bus and train from Hyderabad (205 km away) and Nizamabad.

Heritage in Warangal
Ramappa Temple
Warangal in the Deccan plateau is home to the very classic and brilliant Kakatiya art. The Ramalingeswara Temple which is popularly known as the Ramappa temple is one such amazing piece of art that stands as a testimony of the royal Kakatiyas. The temple got its name Ramappa because of its chief sculptor Ramappa. It's probably the only temple in the country to be known by the name of its sculptor. The medieval Deccan Ramappa Temple which dates back to 1213 AD, was built by the patronage of the Kakatiya ruler Kakati Ganapathi Deva under the authority of his Chief Commander Rudra Samani at the place known as Ranakude in the Atukuru province. The Ramappa temple is the right destination for people who admire architectural brilliance and have a panoramic view of true scenic beauty. The temple is situated in Palampet village of the Venkatapur Mandal, in Mulug Taluq of Warangal.
The Ramappa temple has been referred as the brightest star in the network of medieval temples in the Deccan region. You can reach the temple via a royal garden, which is now reduced to a lawn with a path paved by trees. Another striking feature of this temple is that it is built with bricks that are so light that they can easily float on water. The temple which is situated in a valley took nearly 40 years to be completed. Elaborate carvings line the walls and also cover the pillars and ceilings of the temple.
The Ramappa temple finds its hold on a 6 feet high platform on a cruciform plan. The temple's chamber is crowned with a shikharam and is surrounded by pradakshinapatha. At the entrance of the temple, we can find a Nandi mandapam. An imposing Nandi vigraham stands on it.

The government has taken many steps to restore the heritage of Gadwal fort. It is located near Gadwal town, between Hyderabad and Kurnool at a distance of 16 km from Erravelli Junction on Bangalore-Hyderabad NH 7.
