The perspective goal of the project is to build the first ‘Photonics Valley’ of the world. The valley or the ecosystem is expected to institutionalize / accommodate all the exponents and stake holders of ‘Photonics technology’.
The rationale of the project is to evolve an ecosystem in Hyderabad for mobilizing all the stakeholders. The stakeholders include technology partners, supply chain and manufacturing industries, research institutes etc.,
The ecosystem is located at a very vantage point in Hyderabad city. It is located in e-City or erstwhile Fab city near the International Airport. It's inches away from the outer ring road. 300 acres of land has been earmarked for the ecosystem.
The e-City is already provided with basic infrastructure and provided with an exclusive 225 KV power station. Further 2.4 MGD water supply is ensured.
The ecosystem is endowed with Electronics Manufacturing cluster (EMC) status. The EMC status is sanctioned by Government of India to promote manufacturing activity in ESDM sector. The EMC is supported with more than 50% of infrastructure development funds and tax sops from Government of India.
The ecosystem is also endowed with Information Technology Investment Region (ITIR) status which enables further advantages for the constituents.
The project is going to be implemented in non chronological phases or tracks. The final objective is to come up with a Photonics chip.
