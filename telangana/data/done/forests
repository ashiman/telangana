Tree Enumeration in Industrial Parks/Plots
Note : NOC for felling trees from Tree Authority/ Appropriate Authority (prior to commencement of construction activities)
In case of Patta lands other than scheduled areas, there is definite procedure formulated for issuing of certificate by 
							concerned Mandal Revenue Officers as regards the nature of the land and the trees grown on the lands. Upon receipt of certificate, 
							DFO issues felling permission to Pattadars and authorize FRO to issue Transit Permits.
As regards trees grown on the private lands of Scheduled Tribes, sufficient
							safeguards are provided under Section 29 (A to G) – preservation of Private Forest of Andhra Pradesh Forest Act, 
							1967 and The Andhra Pradesh Preservation of Private Forest Rules, 1978. District Collector issues felling permission
							and the after receipt of permission, felling, transportation will be done by the forest department, timber will be 
							sold in open auction and the amount realized by sale is deposited into account of the Pattadar. This procedure 
							is working well in the Telangana State.
In case of non-specified trees other than teak, rosewood, sandalwood, red sanders etc, felling permission will
							be given in accordance with WALTA Act, 2002. Even in the case of other then the patta lands like road side plantations etc., permission will be issued like Patta lands.
For the no of  trees felled other than the Patta lands the Applicant has to raise plantation 
							2-5 times the no of trees felled. The applicant has to deposit the money with concerned DFO or raise himself 
							the plantation as per the scheme prepared by concerned DFO
Further, most of the tree species grown by the farmers in their private land are already exempted from Forest Transit Permits.

Improvement of Medicinal Plants in Telangana

Andhra Pradesh has a rich floral diversity.  Out of a total number of 2586 
                species estimated about 1800 species are found to be medicinal plants in Andhra 
                Pradesh. The Govt. of A.P, realizing the rich potential and diversity of 
                Medicinal plants, have initiated efforts not only to conserve the gene pool of 
                Medicinal Plants occurring the forests but also take up ex-situ cultivation with 
                the following objectives (Page No.4).        (Page No.4).

In Situ Conservation
The 
              FRLHT Bangalore through a UNDP ? GOI sponsored project has taken 
              up field study and identified 8 Medicinal Plants Conservation Areas 
              (MPCAs) in different agro-climatic zones covering a total area of 
              2015 ha constituting 0.03% of total forest area in the state.  
              The 8 MPCAs have captured about 700 plant species (632 medicinal 
              plants) out of   a total number of 2586 plant species 
              (1800 medicinal plants) in A.P. The Forest Department through reference 
              No.22453/98/U2 dt.10.11.2000 declared MPCAs as no-harvest zone prohibiting 
              all activities such as grazing, lopping, felling etc.    The following are the MPCAs identified.

The 
              Forest Department made significant strides in the field of medicinal 
              plants during the past 5 years.  The following are the highlights:
a.
4 
                Ethno-botanical gardens with about 400 species were established 
                in the 4 Regional Research Centers in the state located at Rajahmundry, 
                Tirupathi, Mulugu near Hyderabad and Achuthapuram in Khammam District 
                to create awareness on Medicinal Plants among the officials and 
                staff of the department and the general public. Sample plots of 
                different Medicinal plants are raised in these gardens.  
                The Ethno-botanical garden at Rajahmundry has an Arboretum too 
                with various tree species collected and planted basing on Bentham 
                and Hooker?s classification. The production of seed and seedlings 
                of different species for utilization as planting material is also 
                achieved in these gardens on a limited scale.  There is an 
                enormous scope for increasing this activity.
b.
The 
                BIO-TRIM at Tirupathi has got fairly modern equipment to go in 
                for a regular research work on various aspects including analysis 
                of active principles and development of protocols for different 
                species on production of tissue culture plants fairly in large 
                number.
c.
Field 
                trials of different varieties have also been taken up to arrive 
                at suitable variety for a given agro-climatic zone.    
                For these species which respond well for vegetative propagation 
                CMA plots are raised in each of the Research Centers.    Already production of large number of Grafts and Clonal plants 
                of tree species of medicinal value for planting throughout the 
                state as a prelude to cultivation of herbs, shrubs and climbers 
                of medicinal value, particularly by involving VSS is going on 
                a large scale.
d.
e.
The 
                Department has published a number brochures and books to popularize 
                conservation of Medicinal Plants. Some of them are ?A field guide 
                on medicinal plants?, ?A profile on dye yielding plants? and ?Cultivation 
                of medicinal and aromatic plants?.
f.
The 
              Department has conducted Rapid Assessment Surveys (RAS) on occurrence 
              of medicinal plants in all the three regions of the state followed 
              by workshops at  Warangal, Rajahmundry and Tirupati to discuss 
              different medicinal plants identified and the ailments for which 
              they are used and preparation of databank of Medicinal plants available 
              in the state.  As a result of Rapid Assessment Survey (RAS) 
              data on The List of Medicinal Plants occurring in Nallamalai Hills 
              in particular and in the entire State district-wise in general has 
              been compiled.
Improvement of Degraded Forest Lands:-
These 
              lands are having either sparse growth or totally no growth. Proper 
              site preparation and adequate soil and moisture conservation works 
              will be taken up for a better moisture regime and planting Medicinal 
              plants is taken up. Grafts / Tall plants of tree species and herbs 
              and shrubs are raised simultaneously. Mechanical supports will be 
              given for the climbers planted.

Beedi [ Abnus ] Leaf Trade

State Trading in Beedi Leaf during the year 2002 - 2003
The Beedi leaf trade was Nationalised in all the 10 Districts of Telangana Region with effect from 9-11-1970 through the Andhra Pradesh Minor Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) ordinance which was subsequently replaced by the A P Minor Forest Produce Act, 1971 (Act 4 of 1971). In the year 1987, the Departmental collection of Beedi Leaf was taken up by eliminating the middlemen and the A P Forest Development Corporation Limited was appointed as Agent to the Government which financed the Scheme with Margin Money provided by the Government and at the end of the financial year remits to the Government, all the net revenue after repayment of Bank Loans with interest and meeting the relevant components of expenditure as per the scheme. Thus from the year 1988-99 the Government accounts show only the net revenue realised by the Department as against the normal gross revenue figures shown till 1987-88. The Departmental Collection of Beedi Leaf Scheme is basically a social welfare scheme as it is totally labour oriented. There are in all 366 beedi laef units spread over all the 10 districts comprising of 22 Divisions of Telangana Region under 5 Territorial Circles and the Field Director, Project Tiger, Srisailam. Departmental collection of beedi leaf was continued upto 1996 season and local persons mainly from the tribals and weaker sections were appointed as khalladars to supervise the collection, curing bagging and transport of beedi leaf to godowns. Only good leaf fit for making at least one beedi was delivered to purchasers at godowns. Since 1997 the policy has been revised for collection of beedi leaf in Telangana Region where in the green leaf will be collected and handed over to the purchasers, on the day of collection. All operations like Pruning, Appointment of Khalladars, Curing, Handling, Transportation of leaf to godown will be taken up by the Purchasers only.
Legislation on Beedi Leaf Collection & Trade:-
Before introduction of State Trading in Abnus Leaves in 1971, the right to collect abnus leaves was sold by public Auction on lumpsum contract. The private pattadars too, used to sell Beedi Leaf growth in their holdings to the private contractors usually on negotiated terms. When demand and commercial value of beedi leaf had increased private contractors with the help of influential pattadars and local villagers started pilfering and smuggling beedi leaf from the Forests and Government lands leading to considerable loss of revenue to the Government. To arrest this trend, the matter was discussed by the Central Board of Forestry in 1953 which recommended legislative measures to control, the trade of beedi leaf. According the A P Minor Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) ordinance was promulgated in 1970 which was subsequently replaced by Andhra Pradesh Minor Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) Act, 1071 (Act No. 4 of 1971).

Joint Forest 
              Management in Andhra Pradesh
The National Forest Policy 
              of 1988 has recognised the need to involve local people in management 
              of forests for ensuring their effective conservation. The Government 
              of India has issued detailed guidelines in the year 1990 on the 
              concept of implementing Joint Forest Management. Accordingly the 
              Government of Anhra Pradesh has issued formal orders in 1992 for 
              adopting Joint Forest Management (JFM) as a strategy for rehabilitation 
              of degraded forests. Detailed guidelines were also issued in the 
              year 1993, for taking up JFM through village level committees called "Vana Samrakshana Samithies" (VSS).
Like many other State Governments, 
              the AP Forests Department have also issued comprehensive guidelines 
              for adopting Joint Forest Management as a strategy for rehabilitation 
              of degraded forests in the year 1993, through village level committees 
              called "Vana Samrakshana Samithies" (VSS). Initially, 
              there was lot of skepticism among the foresters about the worthiness 
              of this strategy as a remedy for protection problems. This type 
              of approach for managing forests was new to the people also, hence 
              lot of effort was needed to convince the people also about the assurances 
              of the Government on the returns promised to the people, if they 
              take up Joint Forest Management.
However, with the passage 
              of time, both the local people as well as the forest officials started 
              seeing what JFM can do for rejuvenating degraded forests, and the 
              concept gained more acceptance. The success stories spread from 
              one village to another village. What was started as a small program 
              has today attained gigantic proportions. Under the dynamic leadership 
              of the Chief Minster Sri Nara Chandra Babu Naidu, the program attained 
              a state level campaign mode. As the CM himself had said many times, 
              if we have to see the impact of any strategy we have to think big 
              and implement it all over the State, instead of dealing with a few 
              hundred villages here and there.
Keeping in view the tremendous 
              enthusiasm being shown by the people towards this program and the 
              spectacular improvement in forest regeneration due to their efforts, 
              the State Government issued orders on 7-12-96 giving 100% share 
              of timber and bamboo to the VSS members, enhancing it from 50% share 
              envisaged earlier. This is a true sign of the confidence imposed 
              in the ability of the people in managing their forest resources 
              efficiently.
Special 
              features of JFM in Andhra Pradesh
• People are given 
              100% incremental rights over the forest produce, unlike in many 
              other States where the sharing is limited to 25%, with a built in 
              mechanism for recycling 50% of the revenue from timber and bamboo 
              for sustainable management of the forests under their control
• VSS members are given 
              50% of the net revenue obtained from the Beedi Leaf collected from 
              VSS area
• VSS members are also 
              given a share of 50% in the "Compounding Fees" collected 
              from the forest offenders apprehended by them
• Transparency in VSS 
              operations by channeling the funds through Joint Account system, 
              duly supported by the Managing Committee resolutions, and presenting 
              the quarterly progress reports to the General Body
• 50% compulsory enrolment 
              for women in the general body and > 50% in the Managing Committee
• Involvement of Non 
              Governmental Organisations in strengthening the Vana Samrakshana 
              Samithies through motivation, extension, training and other support 
              activities
• SCs and STs are automatic 
              members of VSS. This is to ensure that the poorer sections of the 
              society are not left out.
• Forest areas under 
              cultivation by the poor tribals are being brought under VSS so that 
              the poor people can get employment during the regeneration phase 
              and subsequently draw income from the usufruct. This will also stop 
              the pernicious habit of shifting cultivation
• Medicinal plants 
              occurring in Forest areas have been identified which the VSS members 
              can harvest and market. Plan for regeneration of important medicinal 
              plants, both insitu and exsitu, are being drawn linking with the 
              market.
• Making requisite 
              funds for implementation available by mobilising resources from 
              Employment Assurance Scheme, Centrally Sponsored Schemes and the 
              World Bank, so that work does not suffer for want of money
• With the initiative 
              taken by Government of Andhra Pradesh, the Government of India has 
              also issued guidelines to all states for earmarking funds for forestry 
              sector under EAS and Jawahar Rojgar Yojana
• Effective inter departmental 
              co-ordination for ensuring development of VSS villages as "Model 
              Villages"

FOREST 
              DEVELOPMENT AGENCY

Government 
              of India has formulated a scheme titled “National Afforestation 
              Programme” by merging of four IXth Plan Centrally Sponsored 
              Afforestation Schemes of the Ministry of Environment and Forests 
              namely; Integrated Afforestation and Eco-Development Projects (IAEPS), 
              area oriented fuel wood and fodder projects scheme, (AOFFPS), Conservation 
              and Development of Non-Timber Forest Produce including Medicinal 
              Plants scheme (NTFP) and Association of Schedule Tribes and Rural 
              Poor in regeneration of degraded forests (ASTRP) with a view to 
              reduce multiplicity of the schemes and institutionalizing peoples 
              participation in project formulation and its implementation.
The 
              scheme would be implemented under two tier setup namely; the Forest 
              Development Agencies and Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs). 
              The two tier approach apart from building capabilities at the grass 
              roots level would also empower the local people to participate in 
              the decision making process. FDA can be constituted at the territorial 
              / wild life forest division level and it will be a registered society 
              under Societies Registration Act. At the Grass root level, the JFMCs 
              (in case of Andhra Pradesh VSS/EDCs) will be an implementing agency.

              of FDAs

              schemes.

                  participation in protection and development of forests and that the forest 
                  communities should be motivated to identify themselves with the development and 
                  protection of forests from which they derive benefits. Broadly the concept is 
                  called Joint Forest Management (JFM). Having regard to Forest Policy, 1988, the 
                  Government of India have issued guidelines in the reference fourth read above

Polythene bags raised seedlings of 10 to 12 weeks are planted out in the field. It does not tolerate transplanting since the root system of this species is very delicate. It grows very good from large cuttings (70-80%) success. Dimension of the cutting is 7.5 to 10 cms India . and about 1.8 mt long. They are buried in the ground to a depth of 0.45 to 0.6 mt. Two months before the rains ( i.e.,April-May). The soil should be well pressed around the cutting.

Seeds
Terminalia alata, Heyne,
(Syn. T. tomentosa)
Family : Combretaceae
Common Name : Laurel
Telugu Name : Nalla Maddi
General :
It is most common and most widely distributed. Identified by crocodile skin bark, red blaze and stick-like glands at the base on the backside of the leaf. Development of the tree is best on deep, rich alluvial soils but it avoids sandy soil. Silviculturally it is regarded as suitable for afforesting clayey soils.
Flowering :
The panicled spikes of small whitish flowers appear in May to June.
Fruiting :
Fruits ripen from February to April.
Morphology of the Fruit / Seed :
Fruit is a indehiscent drupe, 3.5 to 5.0 by 1.3 to 2.5 cms in size with 5 coriaceous wings and marked with numerous horizontal lines running from axis to the edges which are thin and irregularly crenulate. Fruits turn brown when ripe.
Seed Collection and Storage :
The fruits are collected by lopping and branches. The best time for the collection of ripe fruits is just after the tree becomes leafless. The fruits are dried in sun for 3 to 4 days are stored in gunny bags. Viability remains for one year.

Detailed guidelines
vss
Annual Working Plan (AWP) should be prepared and 
                  approved as per circular No.4/2004. At the beginning of each 
                  financial year every VSS should prepare annual work plan. It 
                  should be forwarded by the concerned FBO/FSO, Forest Range Officers 
                  and Sub-DFO to the DFO. AWP has to be approved by the respective 
                  DFO. This will ensure the involvement of all the stakeholders 
                  to know atleast the various components of the Annual Work Plan 
                  at the beginning of the financial year.
Estimates should be sanctioned before taking up 
                  works. This is essential for systematic and timely execution 
                  of works. Timely execution of works will yield better results 
                  besides giving sufficient scope for rectification of them, if 
                  need be.
Sanctioned estimates should be translated into Telugu, 
                  the mother tongue of the local communities as well as staff.
The copies of the estimates in Telugu should be 
                  supplied to all the Managing Committee members. The estimates 
                  in their language will make the MC members enthusiastic in planning, 
                  supervising and monitoring the execution of works themselves.
The details of the AWP should be displaced at prominent 
                  places like Panchyat Office or Community hall in pictorial way 
                  and in numbers, for eg. If the AWP is 2.5 lakh for a VSS, it 
                  can be exhibited in pictorial way by showing two big bundles 
                  of rupees and five small bundles of rupees for a given activity 
                  which also should be shown in a pictorial way.
The fund application should be submitted to the 
                  DFO by the VSS.
The funds should be released to the joint account 
                  of VSS. The DFO should issue proceedings releasing funds as 
                  requested after proper scrutiny. The funds can be released on 
                  a quarterly basis in the form of cheques or demand drafts duly 
                  marking the copies of the proceedings to the concerned FBO/FSO, 
                  Forest Range Officer and Sub-DFO.
Execution of works should be done by the VSS as 
                  per the estimate under the technical guidance of the forest 
                  department. Frequent field visits by the FBO/FSO and FRO during 
                  execution will improve the quality of work tremendously.
Check measurements should be done as per delegation 
                  of power detailed in circular no.4. All the field functionaries 
                  of the forest department to check measure the works after recording 
                  the M.B should take the responsibility. This will definitely 
                  ensure proper execution of works. It will thus certainly enhance 
                  the image of the forest department.
The bills/vouchers should be passed for payment 
                  after check-measurement only. Payment to VSS should be done 
                  promptly without causing any inconvenience to them once the 
                  work is executed, recorded and check measured. This will be 
                  one of the indicators of transparency to judge the functioning 
                  of VSS under APCFM.
The VSS should issue cheque from Government account 
                  to VSS account for the amount, for which the work has been done 
                  and bill has been passed. The payment to the VSS members would 
                  be made by drawing funds from the VSS account as per the muster 
                  roll maintained in the presence of as many members of the VSS 
                  as possible to bring an element of transparency in the VSS functioning. 
                  This can be done by the VSS Chair Person and Vice Chair Person 
                  at required and feasible interval and frequency.

building programmes (out of which upto 2005-06 target is 7931 programmes), so
farby the end of March 2006, 8128 programmes have been conducted.
2.1.6 Monitoring and Evaluation of
project implementation
2.1.6.1 Monitoring through FMIS:
A computerized monitoring
package (Forest Management Information System – FMIS) has been developed and
installed in all the Ranges, Divisions, Circles, and Regional Geomatics Centres
and in PMU at Head Quarters. It is a comprehensive package covering all the
Project components and activities.
2.1.6.2. Independent Evaluation:
The Government in their
G.O. Ms. No. 45, EFS&T (For.III) Department, Dated:
26-05-2003
have appointed M/s. Centre for
Public Perception and Policy,
Hyderabad
as Consultants for
independent third party Monitoring and Evaluation of Andhra Pradesh Community
Forest Management Project. The Contract was signed on
28-05-2003
and the assignment has commenced
from
01-06-2003
2.1.6.3 Participatory Monitoring:
The M&E Consultant
has framed the M&E framework for the Project.
2.1.6.4 Policy development:
All actions agreed for
policy reforms have been taken. A statement detailing progress in this regard
is given in annexure.
2.1.6.5
Strengthening the VSS institution:
2.1.6.5.1 Legal status to VSSs:
As an initiative to
empower the communities involved in participatory forest management, legal
status is sought to be accorded to the VSS by amending the A.P. Forest Act
1967. The GOAP agreed to the proposals of the Forest Department. The cabinet
has also cleared it. The Draft bill has been
2.1.6.5.2
Decentralization of planning and financial management:
The Government during
January 2004 have amended the AP Forest Department Code providing for direct
funding to VSSs without routing the funds through Forest Range Officers. This
amendment has come on account of a study conducted under the APCFM Project.
Implementation of this new system has commenced in the right earnest during
this year. This while addressing the workload on the implementing staff has
ensured enhanced awareness and participation of the VSSs in financial
transaction. This amendment ensures that the cashbook of the VSS is the primary
cashbook of the Forest Department. Thus the financial responsibility is now
with the VSSs. There is clarity in the role and responsibility of VSS and
Forest Department and this ensures decentralization and transparency.
2.1.6.5.3
Reforms to VSS structure:
The present structure of VSS institution has emerged during
JFM phase. CFM initiative brought in certain improvements especially in gender
issues. With commencement of flow of benefits and usufruct to the VSSs there is
now need to look carefully into the structure and functioning of the VSSs
especially with regard to profile of membership. As a measure to ensure
convergence with Velugu initiative enrolling poor families left out as members
of VSSs, promoting SHGs and federations are underway. But before these are
pursued further, there is need to commence a process of consultations.
Experience has brought out that heterogeneity of membership of VSSs in terms of
economic profile, degree of forest dependence, extent of participation in protection
and management of forests, viewed in the context of commencement of benefit
flow is likely to complicate matters in the coming years and conflicting
relations are likely to emerge on account of these. Thus there is a need to
address these issues adequately and at the earliest. This is required more to
ensure that all active members of VSSs who invariably are the poorest of the
poor and who really depend on the forests and who have built their institution
of VSS derive maximum benefits from the forests. In this context apart for
providing legal status to these VSSs through an amendment to AP Forest Act
1967, it is proposed to organize VSSs into Societies. To ensure livelihood
enhancement of forest dependant families to development and management of forest
based enterprise a new institute was structured, functioning at various levels
having an organic linkage with the Government and Non-Government agencies and
institutes has been proposed.
2.1.6.5.4
Revision and implementation of R & R Policy:
1-5-2003
, the revised R&R
Policy and RAP were put for series of consultations with all the stakeholders,
particularly with VSS communities, during May to August, 2003, at
Range/Division/Circle and State Level.

and Chinakonam VSS in Visakhapatnam District. The Members also discussed with
the VSS members, NGO and forest staff during their field visits. The group
concluded their visits with the following remarks.
1.
The biggest strength of the Programme is that there is no physical relocation
of people in the programme planned and development in reaching them in their
traditional habitat.
2.
About 50% of the affected families are being compensated by way of land
development programme which is the biggest strength of the programme.
3.
The programmes identified to compensate the loss for the households who do not
have land, i.e, value addition programmes in adda leaf, tamarind, bamboo,
preparing vermicompost are good. Emphasis is to be given for vermicompost
making in all the VSS and a tie up can be made by the Forest Department in
buying back the vermicompost for the nursery and plantation programmes.
4.
The members are pleased to see the effort being made by the Forest Department
Staff jointly with the NGO’s and VSS members in proper implementation of the
RAP programme, and the committee wishes to place on record the good work being
done by the department staff.

The development objective of the Project leans
heavily on activities under this component as this account for more than half
of the project investments. Activities under this component are
¨
Improvement of forests
vested with VSSs through rejuvenation of existing root stock and artificial
regeneration coupled with sound silvicultural interventions of selective
thinning and stand management practices, soil and moisture conservation works.
These activities aim at enhancing productivity and sustained yield of forests
under the management of VSSs. While forests with reasonable extent of viable
rootstock of important species are to be rejuvenated, degraded bamboo forests
will be improved by removing clump congestion and soil working. Scrub forests
without economically important species will be replaced by high yielding short
rotation timber yielding, NTFP and Medicinal plant species through artificial regeneration.
Social forestry through
development of forest resources outside forests through promotion and support
for farm and community forestry.
Applied research focusing
on genetic improvement of selected species and standardizing techniques of
their propagation, improving the silvicultural prescriptions for management of
degraded forests.
Developing mechanisms and
tools for forest inventory for realistic assessment of impacts and
Development of a
comprehensive Forest Management Information System.
Given below is a gist of achievements in these
activities.
2.2.1
treatment:
Project targets improvement of 315,800 ha of forests under
management of VSSs. This includes improvement of 150,000 ha of teak forests,
100,000 ha of non teak miscellaneous forests, 50,000 ha of degraded bamboo
forests, 5000 ha of red sanders forests and conversion of 10,800ha of scrub
forests by artificial regeneration with short rotation woody, NTFP and
medicinal plant yielding species. As against this, by the end of March 2006 an
area of 3, 24,948 ha were treated. Details of the area treated so far since inception

Treatment of forests is the major activity of this project
and this creates tremendous amount of employment opportunities to the VSS
members especially during lean working season.
2.2.1.1
Rejuvenation of teak forests:
This model is widely used in degraded natural teak
forests of Telangana region and in degraded old teak plantations of other
areas. As against the project target 150,000 ha, an area of 1,47,910 ha has
already bee treated. No area has been taken up for treatment this year as the
project target had been achieved by and large. Treatment of these areas include
shrub cutting as advance work, cutting back and coppicing viable root stocks ad
high stumps that have resulted due to hacking and illicit cutting in the past,
coppicing the stumps that are cut back and singling the multiple shoots that
emanate upon coppicing. These activities are coupled with soil and moisture
conservation works like gully plugging structures, mini percolation tanks,
continuous contour trenches and staggered trenches, fire control measures,
protection from grazing, staggered trenches to facilitate moisture conservation
for the benefit of economically important and naturally growing NTFP plants in
the treatment area. Since teak forests are deciduous forests, they are highly
susceptible for fire damage and due to repeated fire damage soil is depleted.
However required SMC works are being taken up on the concept of water shed
basis during the current year to consolidate the area already treated.
2.2.1.2
Rejuvenation non-teak miscellaneous forests including red sanders forests:
Non teak forests are
distributed in the coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema belt. Non teak miscellaneous
forests of the north coastal Andhra Pradesh in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram,
Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts represent the transition between
north Indian Sal forest belt and the central Indian Teak tract with no major
species dominating. These are rich in biodiversity and also an abode to a
number of tribes. These forests are under varying degrees of degradation due to
biotic pressure and inadequacies in management practices to which they were
subjected to in the past. Non-teak forests of Rayalaseema are predominated by
abundant occurrence of
Pterocarrpus santalinus
Chloroxylon
coloratus
2.2.1.3
Rejuvenation of bamboo forests:
Bamboo occurs abundantly in the forests areas covered
under this Project. In fact out of 5000 VSSs supported under this Project
Dendrocalamus stricus,
Bamboosa arundinaceae
D. hamiltonii
D. strictus
2.2.1.4
Artificial regeneration:
It can be seen from the data given above that as against the
Project target of 10,800 ha of artificial regeneration of scrub forests with
SRWP, NTFP and medicinal plant species, an area of 40,006 ha has been treated.
This is due to site-specific requirement of forest treatment. During 2005
planting season an area of 18,139 ha has been planted with 13.29 million
seedlings of SRWP, NTFP and Medicinal plant species. Seedlings planted are of
Pongemia
pinnata, Emblica officinalis,
Tamarindus indica,
Annona squamosa, Sapindus emarginatus, Tectona grandis, Dendrocalamus strictus,

     production and improve yields by producing superior planting stock.
Transfer
     of technology
Details of achievements and plan of
action are given in the annexure.
2.2.4
inventory:
This activity has been contemplated for implementation
during the third year of the Project. However as a part of microplanning
baseline survey of forest resources is being done through field inventory. The
methodology prescribed on the Project Implementation Plan is being followed for
the purpose. Data collected in this exercise will also be made use of along
with the regular inventory planned as detailed above. For a regular inventory a
cell with competent officers and a clear mandate is being constituted and it is
expected that this exercise will be competed within the remainder of the
Project period.
2.2.5
Management Information
System:
FMIS package has been developed with three operational
modules i.e. Community Forest Management module, Financial Management module
and Forest Inventory module. All inputs and report formats are developed using
Visual Basic and Crystal Reports. The package will help in conversion of
reports into formats of Spreadsheets for use in tandem with any additional
information if need. It will also have facilities for data transmission through
Networks and Internet. Detailed features and present status of each of the
modules are given below:
2.2.5.1
This module covers all VSS
activities connected with basic information about VSSs, details of house hold
data of members of VSSs, details of micro plans prepared for these VSSs. In
integration with the Financial Management module it facilitates monitoring and
evaluation of physical and financial progress of these activities. It provides
for MIS at VSS level.
2.2.5.2
Financial Management:
This module provides for preparation of Annual work plans at
Division, Circle and State level, Budget Estimates, Budget allocations and
Revision of Budget estimates. It provides for detailed monitoring of each work
and its components like preparation and sanction of work estimates following
schedule of rates, financial transactions, and generation of reports that are
required for monitoring and evaluation of various items of various activities
of various components. Specifically, this module provides for generation of
statutory financial reports and reports required for monitoring Project
performance. Data on all financial transactions for the year 2002-03, Annual
Work plans for 2002-03, 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06 are available in this
module. It provides for generation of all financial reports including Financial
Management Reports and Reimbursement claims for the Project.
2.2.5.3
Inventory:
This module captures data
pertaining to growth and yield statistics gathered in
inventory exercises and
Baseline surveys and generates reports on forest stands, their basal area,
their volumes, status of regeneration etc. The data generated in this module
will be vital for Planning, Monitoring and Impact assessment in terms of
incremental growth resulted due to various inputs into the forestry sector.
2.2.5.4
Training and Implementation status:
Training and implementation support is extended by
providing technical assistance in the form of IT facilitators as individual
consultants sufficiently trained in handling the package to all the Circles and
Divisions and PMU. Trainings have been imparted at the A.P. Forest Academy,
Dullapalli for selected forest department staff of all the cadres i.e. Range
Officers, Accounts Superintends, Accountants, Draughtsman, Range clerks etc.
District level trainings are also conducted for staff or the above categories.
2.2.5.5
Future Plan of Action:
Following are further activities planned:
2.2.5.5.1 Importing the database to Oracle and integrating
MIS and GIS:
Data saved in FMIS from time to time has been converted from
access to Oracle as relational database with back-up facilities. An interface
has been developed for the Oracle database and FMIS package for real time
operations as the Access database cannot manage huge amount of data.
2.2.5.5.2
Establishment of regional IT centres and Networking:
3 more regional IT centres
at Adilabad, Visakhapatna and Tirupathi are being established in addition to 3
existing at
2.2.5.5.3
Development of on-line geo database and Web GIS:
Huge amount
of database is developed and archived
It is proposed to keep this database
in the form of geo-database on-line through intranet by connecting all offices
upto Division level and to integrate MIS database with GIS database. In
addition to providing on-line database availability to all forest offices for
regular use and for updation of information, as part of the government policy,
it is decided to keep some information of department’s activities and services
on Internet.
2.2.5.5.4 Departmental web site:
The department website is
available on
www.ap.nic.in/apforest
2.3 Community development:
This component aims at
bringing about holistic development of VSS communities focusing particularly on
the vulnerable groups, social safeguards, bridging critical gaps in the
endeavour of the project objective of poverty reduction through income
generation activities to bring in an element of sustainability in the project
implementation. Following are the activities contemplated:
Supporting development of
community infrastructure (on a limited scale) for VSS groups.
Supporting the processing
and marketing of wood and non-wood forest products (NTFPs) through APFD and NGO
extension and training.
Supporting poor, landless,
women and other vulnerable groups especially the tribals by improving
livelihood opportunities based on forest and non-forest activities through
income generation activities and micro-enterprises.
Encouraging and
facilitating Participatory planning through micro-planning exercise for
development of holistic plans,
Facilitating livestock
development and augmenting fodder resources.
Evolve and implement
suitable mitigation measures to ward off adverse impacts if any on any person
due to Project implementation.
Activities in the areas of community infrastructure, income
generation, micro-enterprise and micro business, market support will be taken
up in accordance with the prioritised felt needs as documented and articulated
in the microplans. These will also be dovetailed with the other developmental
initiatives taken up by the Government of Andhra Pradesh through World Bank
funded Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project and the District Poverty
Initiation Project popularly called Velugu and other projects.
2.3.1 Tribal Development
Plan:
About 30% of the membership of the VSSs supported under this Project is
of Scheduled Tribes. Project design includes investments in Tribal Development
Plan and also for development of Non Tribal VSS Villages. While the cap on
investment has been fixed at Rs. 100,000 per VSS in respect of VSS with
significant Tribal population (more than 10%), the limit for other VSSs is Rs.
50,000 per VSS. However investment in this current Project is to be made duly
taking care not to repeat investments in VSSs that have already received such
benefit during implementation of APFP. Further in order to maximise impacts
from these investments, activities that ensure sustainable management of
natural resources available and vested with the VSSs are planned and their
value additions by the Common Enterprise Groups who are informally in position.

So far 1398 VSS benefiting 34803 families have
been covered under TDP and 427 VSSs with 13427 beneficieries under VDP. Following
are the important activities taken up by VSSs under these programmes. Focus is
on livelihood generation. Activities undertaken for providing common
infrastructure facilioties are detailed in the Annexure dealing with Prformance
indicators.
2.3.1.1
Support for value addition and marketing of bamboos:
Bamboo occurs
in abundance in Andhra Pradesh. Andhra Pradesh accounts for about 7.4% of
’s Bamboo
resources. More than 1000 VSSs have abundant resources of Bamboo and their
economy can scale up significantly with Bamboo related intervention. Bamboo is
also known as poor man’s timber. It has a number of applications in various
forms. During the period of this report Agarabatti sticks manufacturing has
been focussed. As against a paltry Rs. 5 per Bamboo the VSSs are now able to
generate Rs. 25 per Bamboo most of it being in the
form of wage emplo
yment to VSS members in converting Bamboo into Agarabatti
sticks. So far more than 170 tonnes of Agarabatti sticks were supplied by VSSs
in Mancherial, Bellampalli, Jannaram, Kagaznagar and Vizianagaram Divisions.
This activity is being extended to Khammam, Paloncha, Narsipatnam, Srikakula,
and Kakinada
Divisions. Common facility centres that will function as training cum
production cum quality control centres have been established at 5 places. 25
more will be establishe

2.3.1.2 Extraction and marketing of oil
from Boda Grass:
(Boda Grass) is abundant in the
forests of Kadapa and Chittoor districts.
2.3.1.3 Pongamia Oil for bio-diesel:
Steps are taken to establish Bio diesel projects in two VSSs in
Kaghaznagar division of Adilabad district at cost of Rs. 3 lakh each.

2.3.1.6 Leaf plate making with Adda leaves:
Traditionally
the tribals of
,
Vizianagaram,
East Godavari
and
Bhadrachalam areas have been collecting Adda leaf (leaves of
Bauhinia vahlii
and
Vizianagaram districts. Though this activity has been initiated only three
months back, it is picking up like wild fire and is becoming very popular in
the tribal belt. The enthusiasm seen among the tribal women in this activity is
only to be seen to be believed. Sofar marketing is limited to local hotels but
a dialogue has been opened for supplying to major temples who are bulk users of
leafplates on a regular basis.
2.3.1.7 Apiculture (Bee keeping):
Cultivation of Apis
mellifera popularly called European hone bee has been taken up in 131 VSSs
covering 3734 families. These activities have begun in the month of September
2005 and it is expected that by June 2006 about 10 tonnes of honey will be
produced by these VSSs. As this is a new activity, implementation is slow and
guarded. Once the systems are established and skills are acquired and
confidence is gained, activities will be scaled up. Services of private
entrepreneurs is being utilized in training and hand holding.
2.3.2 Community based Eco-tourism:
This is a new
activity included in the Project after consultation with the World Bank during
the visit of its supervision mission in December 2003. Community Based
Eco-tourism involves participation of local communities constituted as VSSs and
Eco Development Committees (EDCs) in management of tourism aspects of protected
areas and areas that have rich biodiversity and that are ecologically sensitive
but have tremendous tourism and educational importance.
A
ctivities taken up under
eco-tourism include:
Planning for community based eco-tourism.
Capacity building of community, training in visitor management,
     catering etc.
Designing and establishing eco friendly infrastructure through
     community participation.
These activities are
being implemented in (6) identified sites.
The following is the

Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary, East Godavari District
The Community Based
Eco-tourism in Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary is proposed to be implemented in two
parts. In the initial phase the visit of the tourists to the mangrove area will
be conducted by the community and the visit to the Hope island will be taken up
in the second phase as the procurement of a sturdy sea worthy boat is essential
and it is expensive. Seeing the success of the project the procurement of the
boat and visit to the Hope island will be taken up.
The number of visitors to
Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary has increased due to the awareness in the public and
under Community Based Eco-tourism project facilities like wooden board walk and
cottages for stay of visitors have been created. A present the visitors are not
being charge as further facilities like Boat ride, interpretive guided tours
etc, are planned. Once the facility gets sufficient publicity and the
visitation rate improves, the Community Based Eco-tourism members will fix a
remunerative tariff.

Project Impacts:
The developmental objective of the Project is to
reduce rural poverty through improved forest management with community
participation. Thus there is focus on both forest improvement and community
participation in achieving this objective.
Overview of
Impact:
The development objective of the project is
“to reduce rural poverty through improved forest management with
community participation
Although major benefits and impacts will accrue
beyond the project period, there is still significant impact contributing to
the achievement of the project objective at this point:
o
From out of
147,910 ha of teak forests treated, about 45,000ha of area would yield timber providing
Rs. 1800 Crores revenue;
Considerable
bamboo production potential developed with Rs. 500 Crores;
Increase in natural forest NTFPs by an estimated 20
percent through forest treatments and new NTFPs such as gum and bixa are being
added to the list being collected by VSS;
In a 20 VSS
sample, standing wood volume increased by 8.5m
Significant improvement in ground water regimes
through soil and moisture conservation works benefiting both the forest and
adjacent communities;
20,000 ha of clonal eucalypt plantations established
with the potential to provide an annual yield of 10 tonnes worth Rs 40
Crores.
A study of 20 VSS forest areas showed that between
1996 and 2005 the area under dense forest has increased by 66 percent while the
area under open forest (less than 40 percent canopy cover) has increased by 4
percent.
The use of improved seed and clonal planting materials
provided through the project’s applied research program is improving yields of
wood and NTFPs planted within VSS by a minimum of 20 to 25 percent.
495 ha of multi-locational trials for short rotation
wood and NTFP species established in 122 VSS are already starting to yield data
on optimal clones for each site, while VSS have started to benefit from the
harvest of NTFPs, such as tamarind and seetapple.
Women’s status has been improved with 426 VSS having
woman chairpersons, while in 131 VSS both chairperson and vice-chairperson are
women.
5.1 Impact on Forests through treatment practices:
treatment is
an important component of the Project and accounts for 54.12 % of the Project
outlay. This component and its activities are key to achieving the development
objective while the tone and tenor of all the activities of other components
also are associated with this component and its activities in one way or the
other. Activities here include rejuvenation of degraded forests of the
VSSs
Achievement made in the area of treatment of
forests for their improvement is substantial. Infact the Project target of
treating 315,800 ha has already been achieved. What is significant in this
achievement is that implementation of these activities has followed site
specific planning and site specific adaptation with innovation. The
organization and implementation of Soil and Moisture Conservation works has
been done through a professional and objective approach of treating on
watershed basis and aiming at conserving 10% of the precipitation that is
received in the given area. Various structures are designed and located basing
on a highly scientific approach. A significant initiative taken here is
construction of twin purpose structures of continuous contourbtrenches with
septa and with a relatively shallow depth of 0.5 Meters to serve the purpose of
soil and moisture conservation during monsoon and post monsoon seasons and as
fire control measures during summer months when fire occurrence are otherwise
rampant. This initiative minimises the cost and maximises utility.
Treatment of teak forests has been done over an
area of 147910 ha as against the Project target of 150,000 ha. Similarly as
against treating 100,000 ha of misc. hardwood forests an area of 78728 ha has
been treated. This includes treatment given to Red sanders forests. Most of the
treatmenty given have been quite effective in that the degraded uneven stands
have iroved in quality and there is better growth in terms of quality and
quantity. To some extent the negative selection that had occurred due to
inadequate management before bringing these forests under the management of
VSSs has also been set right during the course of cutting back, coppicing and
singling. However it is felt that all efforts made here will only result in
consolidation and improvement of the available genetic recource of the stand.
Further the site and other edaphic conditions also bring in lot of limitations
to further improvement of these stands. While an estimated 30% of these sites
have potential of graduating to timber yielding forests in due course, the
remaining may at best remain at pole stage. Though these pole yielding forests
also have utility and commercial value, from the prespective of biodiversity
conservation and maximising returns from these forests, there is a need to
upgrade their quality. It is in this backdrop that in about 30,000 ha Bamboo
and a few medicinal plants have been introduced in the exiting gaps through
underplanting. While this experiment is a year old and though initial results
are quite promising, with the experience gained in this regard, a larger target
for the remainder of the Project period can be thought of.
Rejuvenation of Bamboo forests that has occurred
over an area of 27230 ha as against the Project target of 50,000 ha is also a
significant achievement. In the VSSs in Adilabad, Vizianagaram,
and Khammam
Circles this activity results in utilizing the Bamboo poles coming on account
of decongestion operations for converting them into Agarabatti sticks. Since
congestion of these Bamboo clumps had put these poles under tremendous stress
and competition for nutrition, as a natural phenomena, these culms (poles) are
sturdy with very little lumen and consequently yield of Agarabatti sticks is
quite high from these compared to the culms growing under more favourable
conditions. Thus operations in these forests, apart from improving the
condition of the crop and future potential yield from them also have become a
source for quick short term revenues from anciliarry activity of Agarabatti
stick making.
Similarly treatment of the Red Sanders forests
results in removal and utilization of Bodha grass (
Cympopogon coloratus
Highlight of the Project’s achievement is
rasining 40006 ha of highquality plantations of Eucalyptus clones, Bamboo and
NTFP grafts of Emblica, Tamarind etc. This is as against the Project gtarget of
10,800 ha. The survival in these plantations is around 90% and growth is
excellent. Infact a plantation of Eucalyptus clones in Khammam Disrrict that
was raised during the JFM phase was harvested during 2005-06 and the yield
obtained was a whopping 7o tonnes per ha compared to 15 tonnes [per ha that was
being obtained from traditional plantations of Eucalyptus hybrid. These
plantations bear tremendous potential for sustainability of the Project
initiatives in the years to come.
The various clonal multi location trials raised
have potential of emerging as gene banks of high yielding potential and are ex
situ conservation sites as well as sources of plant material for further
extension.
5.1.2 Impact
on improvement in vegetation cover:
Independent studies
made by National Remoting Sensing Agency and by the Geomatic Information Centre
of AP Forest Department in 20 VSS forest areas has shown significant
positiveimpacton the venegative cover consequent to implementation of
ParticipatoryForestry Management in general and AP Community Forestry Maagment
in particular. The study by the NRSA,
has reprted as follows:
“……
O
verall trend of the analysis showed
that forest vegetation within the VSS limits has been preserved intact and
vegetation has increased in at least one third of the total sites studied….
Considerable portion of the positive changes accrued are due to planting
activities taken up in 2004 and 2005 planting seasons. These activities showed
up as removal of vegetation at places in satellite data at the first instance ,
later confirmed from ground as removal of vegetation for planting purpose.
General increase of crown density was found mainly due to resurgence pioneers
like bamboo (Kothrupadu) Xylia, Anogeissus (Tatiwada), Teak (Mahaveertanda,
Linethanda), red sanders mixed (Gadela) in protected areas. Strict protection
regimes implemented in VSS areas seems to have drastically brought down the
illicit cutting and aided stock improvement…..
………Based on the study involving multispectral remote sensing
and GIS techniques to assess the change in VSS areas following conclusions
could be drawn.
Barren and scrub areas have shown clear addition of forest
cover in at least one third of VSS area out of the total. Prominent among them
showing increase of vegetation were Line Thanda (53.9ha), Mahaveerthanda
(36.7ha), Irukuvalasa (19.2ha), Gadela (29.8ha), Gaddiganapally (14.3ha) and
Nallavelly (39.6ha).
In general vegetation within the VSS limits has been
preserved intact and has shown no degradation trend as such. This in itself can
be a sizeable accomplishment especially in view of pressures prevail in forest
edge areas.
Majority among the rest showed improvement in terms of
increase in crown density within existing forest canopy and fresh plantation
activities. Among them Dhantalpally (15.3 ha), Behrunguda (13.1ha) Indarpur-SC
(16 ha) Vanjavarigumpu figured prominent. …..
Some smaller patches in particular VSS areas have also shown
removal of vegetation as illustrated in Ambuka (1.0ha) and Indrapur-SC (0.6ha).
Considerable portion of the positive changes accrued are due
to planting activities taken up in 2004 and 2005 planting seasons. These
activities showed up as removal of vegetation at places in satellite data at
the first instance, later confirmed from ground as removal of vegetation for
planting purpose.
General increase of crown density was found mainly due to
resurgence pioneers like bamboo (Kothrupadu) Xylia, Anogeissus (Tatiwada), Teak
(Mahaveertanda, Linethanda), red sanders mixed (Gadela) in protected areas.
Strict protection regimes implemented in VSS areas seems to have drastically
brought down the illicit cutting and aided stock improvement. Middle infrared-based
combination could enhance such cases and interpretation carried out to capture
it…….”

(study conducted on 48 sites during 2005-06) also coroborate the above.
Following are the key findings of this study:
“……The
practices adopted in the project, have not only helped in minimizing the
degradation of the forests, but improved the forest areas around the Forest
Dependent Communities (FDC) villages and habitations. Many VSS forests, in near
future will support stands with quality timber and diverse NTFPs…..
Impacts on the State of the Forests:
…..The regeneration that
is taking place in most of the study sites can be considered as secondary
succession and may take a long time to attain a stable community. However, with
the several types of interventions and in puts through the APCFM project, now
the secondary succession under CFM can be regarded as
Engineered Succession

Engineered succession
On the other hand, as a result of
the treatment practices adopted in different VSS of various forest types, the
vegetation quality, in terms of species richness, species evenness, tree
densities and ground occupancy, cover, wood productivity and NTFP flows, has
started improving in all the sites sampled as was evident from the
contributions by the recruitment class of trees.
The number of VSS (of the total 48
sampled) that ranked in the top two quality classes for different attributes
are as follows:
Tree Species Richness was

……….On the whole, the impacts at
the local level can be summarized as below:
Ø
Over 10% area
has moved into dense category; and if the same trend continuous, by the end of
2010, 60% of the VSS areas will be under dense cover.
The density of
trees has increased and expected to stabilize between 250-400/ha.
Species
richness in the trees category is increasing in 25 sites. (out of 48 studied)
Incidence of fire
was reported at 28 sites during Pre-JFM times and now the incidence is nil at
these sites.
2 New NTFPs
(Gum) and Jafra (Bixa orelana) are added to the list of traditional NTFP
collections by the communities through Community Forest Management.
Improvement in

………..APCFM,
through its 5000 VSSs in 14 districts of Andhra Pradesh has brought more than a
million and a half of the once degraded forests in to the productivity line
through communities’ participation. Thus, the micro level beneficial impacts of
the programme is extended to nearly 5.17% of the state’s geographical area, and
22.28% of the state’s forest area.
……..During
the year 1996, the state has a Dense forest area of 19%, followed by Open
Forests with 33% and another 33% of the forests under the Scrub category.
Similar trend was observed in case of the different regions
of the state (Figs. 24 to 29). In Telangana region, the dense cover has moved
from 21% during 1996 to 28% during 2003. Blank areas have declined from 14% in
1996 to 7% in 2003. At Rayalaseema region, the dense cover was relatively low
when compared with the Telangana and Coastal Andhra regions. The dense cover of
Rayalaseema has increased from 7% in 1996 to only 8% in the year 2003. However,
the Open cover areas have increased from 42% to 50%, causing substantial
reduction in the blank areas, which were 12% in the year 1996 and declined to
6% by the year 2003. In Coastal Andhra Pradesh, the Dense cover has increased
from 25% in 1996 to 33% by the year 2003. Scrub areas have declined from 30% to
23%; and the blanks have declined from 11% to 8%. Thus, in all the regions, the
areas under Dense and Open forests have increased substantially during the
period from 1996 to 2003. The vegetation studies carried out also revealed
increased cover contribution by the recruitment class of trees in most of the
sites. Thus, the increasing trend of the dense forest cover is continuing…….
……The significant impact of the tree improvement programme
under the APCFM is that, the

On the whole, it can be summarized that the APCFM is
successful in improving the ecology (soils, moisture, climate, productivity,
diversity and wildlife) of the forests under CFM, which accounts for 5.17% of
the state’s geographical area, and 22.28% of the state’s forest area. However,
the real beneficial impacts will be experienced in another 5 to 6 years, when
the yields begin to flow.”
5.1.3 Gains
from investments in applied research initiatives:
The most important mandate fixed for Research
wing under the AP CFM Project is to supply improved planting stock to increase
the productivity of the plantations in the VSS. Under the tree improvement
works, deployment of various short-rotation crops, high-value timber species
and high-yielding NWFP species are the major focus areas. Development of a
sound propagation strategy and standardizing the propagation structures for the
clonal planting stock production was also given high priority.
Conducting Natural Forest Management trials to monitor the
dynamics of the forests and assist in its management is also an important
mandate given to the Research wing under the project.
In
short, Applied Research under the project is being concentrated more on the
issues which are directly relevant for improving the productivity and
sustainability of the VSS such as silvicultural treatment of degraded forests,
clonal technology, improved nursery practices, collection and marketing of NWFP
species including medicinal and aromatic plants, training and extension etc.
It was observed that comparative gains from clonal
plantation are very high over seed-route plantations raised with unimproved,
genetically poor quality seeds. Clonal development and deployment costs for
short-rotation species are lower and gains can be generally larger and quicker
compared to long-rotation species. Low interest rates reduce capital cost and
production costs leading to increased gains.
Wide genetic base of clonal plantations with large number of
clones can minimize such risks.
Apart from clonal technology method, the planting stock
improvement was attempted by establishing Clonal Seed Orchards (CSO) and
Seedling Seed Orchards (SSO).
Traditionally seedlings are raised from the seed and
used for planting with 20-25 MT/ ha after 8-10 years. A remarkable progress has
been achieved in improving the productivity of Eucalyptus plantations through
Clonal Forestry. The Research wing has so far supplied 14.66 lakhs of clonal
planting stock of Eucalyptus under CFM programme for planting in the VSS with
intensive site preparation methods and kept 19 lakhs of clonal planting stock
ready for planting during 2006 planting season.
Expected yield per ha after 7 yrs –50 MT if planted with
clonal material (the yield figure is taken from the APFDC clonal plantation
harvesting figure) and 25 MT if planted by ordinary seedlings.
R&D Circle
kept ready 19 lakh of
committed clonal planting stock of Eucalyptus for supply to the VSS plantation
to be taken up during 2006 planting season.
Efforts have been made on genetic improvement of

Yield per Ha. if planted by ordinary seedlings is around 60
M.T. per Ha.
NTFP have both utilitarian and socio-economic
importance.
The
value of existing plantations in Research Centers. MLCT have been established
to shortlist the site specific clones for different species. The MLCT will also
provide a valuable source of revenue for the comminuities through sale of the
products and clonal graft scions while being a bisi for improving forest based
productivity. Teak has been used for decades in plantation establishment as a
long-rotation high value species. This species is easily established in
plantation regimes compared to many other high value timber species. In Andhra
Pradesh, Teak Improvement trials started 30 years ago. It is estimated
(assuming planting of 1200-1600 stumps/ha) a seed demand of 12-16 kg of teak
seed per ha of plantation to be afforested. Hence this would require at least 1
ha of clonal seed orchard for each 16 ha of plantation to be established
annually. Teak is a slow-growing species, and therefore tree improvement
programme is a long term investment. In BIOTRIM Tirupati, the micropropagation
of 35000 short-listed clonal planting stock will be ready for deployment in
this planting season.
The mini-cuttings which are 100% juvenile, can be
taken and rooted which form the improved planting stock. The same genetic gain
of 10% is expected from such planting stock. This planting stock can be planted
in 2012 ha and with a minimum of 10% increase in the yield one can expect a
total yield of 313872 cum over 50 years of rotation. The monetary value of this
increased yield accruing due to the deployment of the improved planting stock
is about Rs.9859/- lakhs.
Research has an ongoning
program of maintaining growthand yield within both the natural treated forests
and VSS established plantations.
5.2
Social and economic impacts:
The
other major set of iniatives contributing to the achievement of Project
development objective is community participation and social mobilization. VSS has
been evolving as a managed and more technically competent institution that
considers gender and social equity over the last decade. The iniatives taken
under the Project of addressing gender issues, issues of vulnerable groups, of
participation in decision making will have long term positive repercussions
even in the post project scenario. Out of 5000 VSSs being assisted under this
Project, 3108 (62.16%) have significant Tribal membership. Thus ncluding and
assisting these VSSs will have a significant positive bearing on the overall
relationship between Forest Departmnent and tribal communities. As a consequence
of
5.2.1
Gender issues being addressed:
The constitution of VSS mandates that 8 out of 15
members of managing committee are women and ateast one of either Chairperson or
Vice chairperson is a woman. While forests play a significant role in the lives
of women through utilities as water sopurce and source of domestic energy
(fuelwood), by and large we are dealing with a male dominated society and many
forest management operations and forest protection tasks are traditionally male
oriented. It is hearening to note that in 426 VSSs Women have been functioning
as Chairpersons (in others as Vice chairpersons) and in 131 VSSs both the
Chairpersons and Vice Chairpersons are women. Even in th profile of employment
generation under the Project, women have a share of 45.5% Thus gender issues
are slowly getting addressed.
5.2.2
Income Generation:
The institution of VSS is more than a decade old and the
existing resources in the VSS managed forest area had been treated on the sound
principles of forest management by the VSS with an idea of making them
productive. Besides this lot of assests created by way of raising artificial
regeneration of SRWPs, NTFPs, medicinal plants and by way of taking soil and
moisture conservation works. The community leadership at places have become
strong enough to take up further activities in the area of value addition and
marketing for making the VSS sustainable. In quite good number of VSSs, income
has started generating from few thousands to few lakhs. As per the information
collected on the income generated from various forest produces and their value
addition in few cases during the year 2003-04,2004-05 and 2005-06, it has been
recorded as Rs.67.79 Crores. This is the total income generated which
essentially includes the value of the forest produces comsumed by the VSS
members locally as the domestic needs as well as the quantities sold. The
various sources of income in the VS’S are small timber, poles, firewood,
bamboo, grass, NTFPs
What is significant to note here is the pattern
of income generation.
5.2.3 Self sufficiency in financial management and book keeping:
Hoistorically
Forest Department has been a conventional and regulatory department with well
defined systems and procedures. It has been a very conservative organization
and guarded in adopting changes. VSSs are institutions primarily promoted by
the Forest Department as the ones to lead and guide the Community in shifting
from estate approach to participatory approach in forest management. Success of
Community Forest Management is heavily depends on the level of maturity of VSSs
and their ability to decide and implement their decisions. One of the
indicators of success in this regard is self-sufficiency of the VSSs with
regard to keeping their own books of accounts. Unlike many other initiatives,
which provide external support in financial management, this Project planned to
create and enhance ability within VSS institution in book keeping. With this in
view, 3 educated youth in each VSS were selected and trained adequately in book
keeping and financial management. Similarly Community Extension Workers also
were trained in this regard. During January 2004, the Government amended the AP
Forest Department Code with reference to financial powers and financial
management. Through this amendment, the Government recognized VSS as an
institution in implementation of works and in handling and managing financial
allocations. In accordance with this amendment, financial allocations made for
VSS works are now being released by the DFOs directly to the VSSs. The
Chairperson of the VSS is the disbursing authority with regard to funds for VSS
works. The VSSs are able to handle and manage the otherwise elaborate
accounting procedure of the Forest Department virtually on their own. Thus the
role of the APFD has now been clearly defined in the APFD code as that of
facilitators and the role of VSS as that of implementers. This clarity has
brought in tremendous amount of confidence and responsibility to the VSSs
enhancing their participation. There is a perceptible improvement in the level
of awareness in the VSSs on account of this policy change.
5.2.4 Employment generation:
Forestry has always been
a heavy source of employment generation especially in the rural sector. In fact
more than 50% of the contribution to livelihoods from forestry is from
employment genetaion potential of forestry operations. Bulk of the area of
Andhra Pradesh state, due to historical and geographical reasons is in rain
shadow region. This being the case the state has suffered from drought for the
last four years. This on one hand and the fact that majority of the members of
VSSs are poor and landless, makes them highly vulnerable and compels them to
migrate for want of adequate livelihood opportunities. Migration is one of the
most cruelties that nature imposes on such target group especially when there
is drought. While migration disrupts and nearly destroys families, it also
adversely affects these vulnerable groups in that none of the welfare measures
taken by the Governments reach them as they are not physically available to receive
them. Considering these situations creation of 23.81 person days of employment
is laudable. Coming particularly in lean months, this Project has provided an
opportunity to all poor members of VSSs in staying back in their respective
villages and access employment available through VSS works. This is a very
important and humane fall out of Project implementation.
5.2.5 Focusing on livelihood enhancement as means
of sustainable forest use:
Focus so far in any Forestry Project has been on
creation and
Managementof
resources
through rejuvenation of degraded forests, artifical regeneration, soil and
moisture conservation activities, fire control etc.
Bamboo based enterprises:
A
comprehensive sector analysis and development of an action plan for harnessing
Bamboo resources in Andhra Pradesh has been made. The state of Andhra Pradesh
accounts for about 7.4% of
Dendrocalamus strictus
Bambusa bambus
Dendrocalamus hamiltonii
Melacona
baccifera
Bambusa tulda
B. polymorpha
B. Balcoa
, Khammam and
Vizianagaram districts. Marketing of these sticks is being done locally as well
as to ITC, Chennai.
nned for the Housing programme undertaken by the
Government of Andhra Pradesh. Another important acgievement is in production of
Bamboo pole based furniture with a market tie up with M/s Byrraju Foundation.
Tribals of
district have
been trained in manufacture of Bamboo pole based chairs and tables for use by
M/s Byrraju Foundatyion. When scaled up this has tremendous export potential.
Significant achievement here is adopting a cluster approach and providing
common facility centres which also function as training com production
centres.
Adda leaf:
Another significant
development which certainly have long term positive impact on the economy of
tribal families especially in the North Coastal Pradesh is initiation of
Apiculture:
Though tried initially,
Apiculture has had limited success in a number of rural development projects.
The limiting factor was lack of adequate hand hoding support and inhibition
among the beneficiaries to handle the bee hives. The APCFM Project, identifying
these constraints has identified small entrepreneurs who can provide hand
holding support. In a small way beginning has been made in Adilabad,
and Vizianagaram
districts covering 131 VSSs and 3734 families during 2005-06. So far 1106 Kgs of
honey has been harvested and the activity is picking up. At present the
colonies are stabilising and honey production will pick up from the next
season.
5.2.6
Institutional and Economic Impacts:
Indepndent study by Ms. Development Research
Services Hyderabad on the economic and institutional spects of the APCFM
Project have revealed the following significant findings:
….Income Effect on Poverty Reduction:
Migration from a lower income bracket to a higher income bracket is one of the
key indicators of poverty reduction across the social groups. During the period
of study 2001-02 to 2004-05, we noticed that the income effect on poverty
reduction among ST groups is more significant than for SCs. Both SCs and STs
together as a group have shifted to higher income groups more significantly
than others. Considering their dependence more on farm and forest produce
incomes, the VSS as an intervention made significant contribution to reduction
of poverty.
Income structure of households: Income structure of households in
different income classes indicates that income from wage continues to be
significant among those whose income is below Rs. 20,000/- ranging between 55
and 62per cent. Higher the proportion of wage income, higher is the average
income per household till the household income threshold reached R.30,000/-.
The NTFP value addition in the higher income brackets has been negligible while
the income from milch animals took a greater slice. Among the medium category
of households, (30,000 to 50,000 category), forestry as a source of income has
a minimal contribution where as in the lower and marginal icome brackets, its
contribution is more than is the case with other categories.
Housing Profile as a Poverty indicator: One of the
important indicators of poverty reduction is the shape and composition of
assets. ‘Housing’ is an important indicator among such assets for
consideration. VSS members in 41 percent of divisions moved to pucca houses
from either kucha or thatched houses. 55 percent of the divisions witnessed a
graduation from thatched to kucha houses. …. Housing profile clearly indicates
that members have crossed the poverty line at significant level. VSS members
thus moved to a higher life security zone.
Alternate livelihoods
Management through VSS is yet another instrumentality for ALH promotion. The
data indicates that following activities have shown varying degrees of
intervention across VSS.

2)
Adda leaf plate making (7 Sample VSS)
3)

related IGAs were taken up in 77 percent of the VSS
studied. These related mostly to soil moisture conservation, raising plantation
of various species and in 12 percent of VSS teak plantations were taken up.
Area allocation to income growth:
The Forest Department made available the area of
land allocated to different VSS in the sample. For each of the VSS, we have
collected data on income at the end of 2004-05. We thought that it would be
worthwhile to relate the income differential between the two reference periods
to the type and size of land allocated. ….We tried to see the association
between land area allocated by the
department and the growth of income in the families studied. It is interesting
to note that despite smaller percentage (Below 20 percent) of land allocation
in WLM Rajampet, Proddatur (WL), Nellore, Chittoor East and Warangal North, the
income growth ranged between 13 and 641 per cent, or an annual growth ranging
from 4.5 to 214 per cent in the triennial period of study. This is because of
the quality of forest allocated and the species engendered in the respective
divisions. Despite larger percentage of area allocated to the VSS in
Kagaznagar, there was negative growth because of the highly degraded forestland
area allocated. Same is the case with Jannaram WL (T) division where there is
only a marginal growth of 5 percent per annum. Here the scope for replanting or
inter cultivation and for rebuilding some community assets like check dams, fish
ponds etc is extremely limited. The storage of run-off water could not be
possible.
But otherwise, one can notice from the evaluation study, that
there is a positive association between land area allocation and growth of
income in the VSS during the period of project implementation. Higher the
percentage of land area allocated, greater is the growth in annual income of
the VSS members.
