Ban on Japanese quail farming
Advantages of quail    farming
Requires minimum floor           space
Needs low investment
Quails are comparatively           sturdy birds
Can be marketed at an early           age ie. five weeks
Early sexual maturity -           starts laying eggs in about six to seven weeks of age
High rate of egg laying           -280 eggs per year
Quail meat is tastier than           chicken and has less fat content. It promotes body and brain           development in children.
Nutritionally, the quail           eggs are on par with that of chicken eggs. Moreover, they contain less           cholesterol.
Quail meat and eggs are a           nutritious diet for pregnant and nursing mothers.

Housing
1. Deep litter system
6 quails can be reared in a           sq.ft. of floor space.
After 2 weeks, Quails can           be reared in cages. This will help to gain good body weight, as           unnecessary wandering of animals is avoided.

Each unit is about 6 feet           in length and 1 foot in width, and subdivided into 6 subunits.
To save space, the cages           can be arranged upto 6 tiers high. There can be 4 to 5 cages in a row.
The bottom of the cage is           fixed with removable wooden plates to clean the bird droppings.
Long narrow feed troughs           are placed in front of the cages. Water troughs are placed at the back           of the cages.
Commercial egg layers are           usually housed in colonies of 10-12 birds per cage. For breeding           purposes, male quails are introduced in the cages in the ratio of 1 to           3 females.
Feed Management
Feed can be formulated as      follows.

Feed material should be           made of small particles
A 5 weeks old quail           consumes about 500 gms of feed
Quails of 6 month old,           consumes about 30-35 gms of feed per day.
Quails require about 400           gms feed for the production of 12 eggs.
Broiler starter mash can be           used by adding 5 kg of oil cakes to 75 feed. The particle size is           reduced by grinding the feed for one more time.
Management of quail    farm
Quail brooder
At the age of six weeks,           female quails usually weigh 175-200 g and the males weigh about           125-150 g
Female quails start laying           eggs at 7 weeks of age and continue utpo 22 weeks of age
Usually egg laying happens           during the evening time of the day
The quail egg usually           weighs about 9-10 g
The breast of the male           quail is usually narrow and covered with equally distributed brown and           white feathers. But the female quail has a broad breast covered with           brown feathers with black dots.
The female and male quails           should be separated at the age of four weeks
Sixteen hours of light per           day should be available to the egg laying quails
Management of quail    chicks
The day old quail chicks usually      weigh 8-10 g. Hence, the quail chicks need more temperature. Absence of      adequate temperature and exposure to high speed cool wind leads to      clustering of young ones, which results in high mortality.
Reproduction
Quail eggs
Quails start laying their           eggs at the age of 7th week. They attain 50% egg production at 8th           week of age
In order to produce fertile           eggs, the male quails should be reared along with the females at 8-10           weeks of age
The male, female ratio is           1:5
Incubation period in quails           is 18 days
With 500 female quails we           can produce 1500 quail chicks per week
Diseases of quails
When there is deficiency of           vitamins and minerals in the female quail breeders, the chicks           obtained from their fertile eggs are usually lean with weak legs. To           prevent this the breeder females should be provided with optimum           minerals and vitamins in their feed
Generally quails are           resistant to infectious diseases than chicken. So there is no           vaccination required for quails
Proper management of quail           chicks, disinfecting farm premises, providing clean drinking water to           quails and feeding of quality concentrate feed will prevent disease           outbreaksin quail farms
Quail meat
Challenges in quail    rearing
Male quails usually make a           different sound which is usually disturbing to the human
When rearing the male and           female quails together, the male quails peck the other quails and make           them blind. At times, death of the quails are also noticed.
Licence requirement    for quail farming
A government license is required      to sell commercial Japanese quail considering the jungle variety of the      bird, which is a protected species. The Ministry of environment and forests      delegated the power to grant such license to the department of Animal husbandry.      Entrepreneurs can also contact Central Poultry Development Organisation,      Mumbai for issue of licences.

QUALITY ASSESSMENT LABORATORY, HYDERABAD
Andhra Pradesh stands 1st  in egg & broiler production, 1st in meat production and 3rd  in milk production.
Need For Quality  Assessment Laboratory:
The  Export of meat to some countries is banned due to high contents of residual  toxins.
There  is a growing demand from importers and exporters to certify on the residual  toxin levels.
To  advise the farmers to have required changes in the packages of practices in  livestock rearing for achieving quality filled products.
Since globalisaton of  trade has increased the opportunities for export of meat, eggs and their  products, there is vast potential for boosting of export of meat, eggs and  their products from our state provided we expand & improve the quality  checks regularly and match the sanitary and phytosanitary standards OR Codex  Alimentarious Standards as per the requirements of importing countries.
Present Export Status:
Al-  Kabeer and Allana which are 100 % Export oriented Units (EOU) situated in Medak  export meat & meat products to Phillippines, Malasia, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar,  Jordan  and Lebenon.
Annually  about 35000 MTs of buffalo meat, 3600 MT of mutton and 4500 Mts of Egg Powder  are exported which amounts to Rs.4145 Crores.
Modern  Abattoir at Chengicherla in RR District handles 6000 sheep & Goats and 400  buffaloes per shift of 8 hours
In view of the above, Government of  AP had a thought to establish a full-fledged Quality Assessment Laboratory at  Hyderabad by providing required latest sophisticated equipment which have  ability to give quick, sensitive and accurate results to meet sanitary and  phyto-sanitary demands with the following mandate.
Mandate of QAL:
To  assess the microbial load in meat, milk, egg and their products
To  assess the residual toxins like Pesticides, Phytotoxins, Mycotoxins, Drugs,  Hormones, Chemicals and Heavy metals in meat, milk, egg and their products
To  assess Pesticides, Phytotoxins, Mycotoxins, Drugs, Hormones, Chemicals and Heavy  metal levels in fodder, feed and water which contribute for presence of  residual toxins in meat, milk, egg and their products
To  build awareness among the farmers on these aspects and motivate them to rear  livestock free of these deleterious items such that we get better export  opportunities.
Establishment of QAL:
Agricultural  and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) has approved  the project proposal of Quality Assessment Laboratory (QAL), at Hyderabad and agreed to  release the assistance to the tune of Rs.124 Lakhs for equipment.
Agricultural  and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) has already  released an amount of Rs. 97,21,600/-.
As per APEDA MoU, the land, laboratory building, its  maintenance and required technical staff only shall be borne by the A.P.  Government and all the revenue from this facility shall be retained by A.P. Government.
At present the construction of Quality Assessment  Laboratory building at Hyderabad  is in final stages.
For procurement of Latest equipment at QAL Building  as per the recommendations of APEDA, tenders are under process, which would be  finalized shortly.
Positioning and Installation of the equipments will  be done after final completion of the building.
The Quality Assessment Laboratory at Hyderabad would be a  state wide institute and will function under the direct control of the Director  of Animal Husbandry.

HUMAN RESOURCES  DEVELOPMENT IN ANIMAL HUSBANDRY DEPARTMENT
The Animal Husbandry Department has  recognized the challenges from the emerging livestock perspective at the  national and state level and has formulated its vision/ mission for guiding the  department to cope with these challenges.
In order to meet the growing challenges and  opportunities emerging in the livestock sector in the post-GATT regime and to  protect the interest of the farmers, the staff of AHD needs to be competitive,  motivated, and committed. They need to understand the market dynamics, group  dynamics, consumer behavior and interpersonal communication skills. Heavy  demand is made on them to maintain high quality production and control. Some of  the staff at senior level are expected to manage a large number of personnel  working under them. To meet all these challenges and concerns, the AHD needs to  evolve and strengthen a sound HRD system with proper vision, mission, goals  ect.
VISION OF HRD
Competent, Confident and Committed Staff  who provide Effective Services to Farmers
MISSION
OF HRD
Conducive  climate for learning and performing within AHD
Right  people at the right place
Resilient  and sustainable training institutional network and infrastructure
Permanent  HRD cadre/faculty
Optimal  utilisation of resources

Pro-farmer  orientation for quality service
GOAL
OBJECTIVES:
Factors  affecting favorable conditions for learning and performing are identified and  addressed
A  permanent HRD faculty with delegated responsibilities and budget is established  with apt specification for personnel, roles and functions.
AHD  staff is oriented to address HRD issues.
Information  system related to staff and staffing is developed and implemented
In the strategic planning process, a  vision/mission statement as well as a clear goal and objectives for HRD in the Department  has been formulated. For achieving these objectives a
two-pronged strategy
Training as a  strategic tool for developing HRD; especially (personnel) management training  for senior level officers

Establishment and  capacity building of HRD faculty, whereby all departmental training centers  (state, regional level and district level) are brought under one umbrella and  staff will be allowed to continue in the field of training.
Training  in AHD
In order to develop the competency of AHD  staff in their job, the department will pursue the following
training  strategy
AHD will adopt the  following principles of training: (I) Training is a continuous activity  throughout the staff career and each staff member will participate in one  training course per year, based on needs, (ii) In service training courses are  short, specific and performance linked and extension will be an integral part  of the courses.
All the training  centers will come under the HRD faculty under the supervision of an Additional  Director
Based on a detailed  training needs analysis (TNA),  mandates,  roles and functions for the different training institutions at three levels  have been defined.
State level  training institutions (SMILDA, SAHTC, Mandapeta, SAHTC, VBRI) are specialized  centers, regional centers (7) focuses on region specific issues and district  training centers (22) will address district specific issues.
The training  centers will have functional autonomy within the framework of an approved  action plan, including budget.

Transport of samples
General instructions for sending the  samples to the diagnostic laboratory  :
From cases of an outbreak at least 4-5 specimens be  collected. Fresh carcass be autopsied.
All specimens collected for Bacteriological/ Virus  isolation must be collected aseptically and dispatched on ice with courier with  instructions to change ice on the way.
Invariably collect the materials for isolation of  etiological agents as well as in 10% formaline for histopathology for complete  diagnosis.
For parasitic diseases collect blood smears and stools/  faeces from 10-15 animals. Put a drop of formaline in stools and fix smears  with alcohol.
Most of the known viruses affecting animals have a  tendency for selective tissue localization. This factor demands the utmost care  in selecting the specimens appropriate for the disease and as free as possible  from bacterial contamination. Tissue specimens may be placed in sterile  wide-mouthed cork stoppered bottles and shipped frozen in dry ice or in 5 to 10  volumes of sterile 50% buffered glycerine saline refrigerated in transit.
Common samples sent to laboratory  examinations for different investigations
1.  BLOOD SMEARS       :             Bacteriological,  Protozological and pathological
Precautions for  collecting materials for Microbiological examination
Material for Bacteriological or Virological  examination should be obtained as free from contamination as possible.
A bunsen burner / spirit lamp may be used for  collection of specimen aseptically and transfer to sterile container.
Suitable instruments including scalpels, scissors and  forceps in sufficient number must be assembled and sterilized.
A convenient and effective method of sterilization is  to immerse the instruments in boiling water containing 2% sodium carbonate for  15 minutes.
A basin containing antiseptic solution should be  available for rinsing the gloved hands at different steps during the autopsy.
Before primary incision is made, the skin of the  surrounding area should be disinfected with a 2% solution of cresol.
Material from body cavities for bacteriological study  is obtained in a manner which will not contaminate others.
Generous blocks of liver, spleen, kidneys, lymph  nodes, lungs, intestinal loop and brain should be removed with sterile  instruments and placed in sterile bottles for transport.
Heart blood may be obtained with sterile syringe or  pipette after searing the surface of heart with hot spatula and shipped in  sterile vials.
Liberal amounts of pus and exudate must be collected  on sterile cotton swabs and shipped in sterile test tubes.
Pleural, pericardial, joint and cerebrospinal fluid  should be collected with sterile syringe and needle and shipped in sterile leak  proof vials.
Thin blood smears and pus smears on clean glass slides  are often of assistance in making a Laboratory diagnosis.
It is essential that material for bacteriological  examination must be held under refrigeration from time of collection until  received in laboratory.
This may be accomplished by the use of ordinary ice or  solid co2 (Dry ice).
Precautions for collecting materials for Serological examination
Precautions for collecting materials for  virological examination: Most of the known viruses affecting animals have a tendency for  selective tissue localization. This factor demands the utmost care in selecting  the specimens appropriate for the disease and as free as possible from  bacterial contamination. Tissue specimens may be placed in sterile wide-mouthed  cork stoppered bottles and transported frozen in dry ice or odinary ice.  Heart blood, cerebrospinal fluid for  identification of virus should be obtained under aseptic conditions and shipped  in sterile vials refrigerated with dry ice.

The mineral deficiency will directly influence on the fertility of the  animals and the animals become infertile and unproductive. The infertile  animals are a burden on the farmers who sell it at a throwaway price. By  identifying the area specific mineral deficiency and providing a suitable  mineral mixture on free cost for a period of 90 days, the problem of  infertility can be overcome.
It is proposed to conduct various trainings to the  farmers on the need based subjects, especially focused on the clean milk  production and also preparation of milk products and its marketing by involving  the Regional Animal Husbandry Trg. centres, District Animal Husbandry Trg.

INTRODUCTION
Since  time immemorial Human Prosperity is linked with the livestock wealth.  It has been rightly said by late U.N.Dhebar  that “To think of Rural Development without Livestock Improvement is to think  of Modern Industrialization without Power Stations”.
Andhra  Pradesh has some of the richest livestock resources in the Country and is one  of the most advanced States in Animal Husbandry activities.  The Livestock play a vital role in  Socio-economic and cultural life of our people.
During the  year 1892, Civil Veterinary Department was established in the composite Madras  State to provide Veterinary Aid to the needy farmers.  Subsequently after Independence, C.V.D was  renamed as Animal Husbandry Department (1948), with the main objective of treatment  and prevention of diseases in livestock.   Initially the emphasis was on health care only, but subsequently several  schemes have been taken up for overall growth of livestock sector.
PHENOMENAL GROWTH
During 50  years of formation of Andhra Pradesh, Animal Husbandry Sector has achieved  phenomenal growth in its different spheres.   With the launching of several five year plans, Animal Husbandry  activities were reoriented towards increased production of livestock products  like Milk, Meat and Eggs, besides providing adequate health care and control of  diseases aiming to improve the economy of rural poor through livestock  rearing.  With its livestock resources  and gradual enlightment of the farmers along with dedicated and sustained  efforts of the Department over the years have elevated the State to a prominent  position in the Country in the Livestock Sector.  The State rose to number one position in  Poultry and Egg Production in the Country.   From a humble beginning of backyard poultry it has grown to a stage of  dynamic industry producing 164534 lakh eggs per annum.  The Milk production also made quantum leap  from 18.08 lakh tonnes in 1979-80 to 76.24 lakh tonnes during 2005-06.  Meat production  increased from 0.96 lakh tones (1979-80) to 4.57 lakh tonnes (2005-06).  Effective Veterinary and Animal Husbandry  services rendered over the years have been the main instrument in achieving  these spectacular production levels.
AN INSTRUMENT OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT
The Livestock Development has  attained the status of an Agro-based industry generating economic growth,  gainful employment and livelihood to many weaker sections in the State.  Small and marginal farmers and landless poor  contributing to 62% of total milk production own 70% of livestock in Andhra Pradesh.  Nearly women provide 60% of livestock farming  labour. Similarly rural shepherds own 90% of sheep population and entire  piggery development is the monopoly of weaker sections.   Thus the livestock sector has become a  powerful tool for socio-economic change and an important priority component in  rural development and poverty alleviation programmes in the State.
ABUNDANT LIVESTOCK WEALTH
Andhra Pradesh is well known for its  livestock wealth.  The State has the  world famous breed of Ongole Cattle an Aseel breed of poultry, which is the  principle source for the development of broiler breeds in the world.  Andhra Pradesh is also famous for Nellore  breed of sheep, which is well known for quality mutton production.
Presently Andhra Pradesh stands  first in poultry (1005.80 lakhs) and sheep population (210.15 lakhs), second in  Buffalo population (107.68 lakhs), seventh in goat population (64.27 lakhs),  and eighth in cattle (94.24 lakhs) and pig population (5.4.9 lakhs) in the  Country.

LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION LEVELS ARE INDICES OF PROGRESS:
The production  levels of major livestock products like Milk, Meat and Eggs are the indices of  progress in livestock sector.  The milk  production has increased from 18.08 lakh tonnes in 79-80 to 76.24 lakh tonnes  in 2005-06. The meat production has increased from 96320 tonnes in 79-80 to  457137 tonnes in 2005-06. The egg production has increased from 17119 lakh nos  in 79-80 to 164534 lakh nos in 2005-06.
The  percapita availability of Milk has increased from 168 gms/day (1997-98) to 286  gms/day (2005-06).  The Percapita  availability of Eggs has increased from 141 nos/annum (1997-98) to 202  nos/annum (2005-06). The Percapita availability of Meat has increased from 9.21  gms/day (1997-98) to 15.35 gms/day (2005-06) inspite of rapid growth in human  population, which is a remarkable achievement.
ANIMAL HEALTH NETWORK:
Over  the last five decades, the animal health sector has untiringly worked to lay  strong foundation of effective animal health network to facilitate animal  production to take off.  Since the  formation of Andhra Pradesh and with the advent of five year plans, rapid  strides were made in the animal health care by opening number of veterinary  institutions in remote areas in the State.
In  the beginning of the Ist Five Year Plan there were barely 8-10 Veterinary  Institutions in each district and about 200 Institutions in the entire State  providing Veterinary Aid covering about 60-70 thousand cattle units under each  institution.  The health care facilities  have increased during the subsequent plan periods resulting in a phenomenal  growth of Veterinary Institutions from 285 during 1956-57 to 5013 during  2005-06.  The cattle units covered now by  each graduate institution is about 10,000 and by including Rural Livestock  Units the coverage goes down to 4730 each.
At  present Veterinary Health cover is provided by 5013 field Veterinary  Institutions comprising of 22 Veterinary Poly Clinics at District level  manned by Deputy Directors as referral  District hospitals providing specialized services in Gynecology, Surgery and  Medicine with X-ray and inpatient facilities, 281Taluk level Veterinary  Hospitals manned by Assistant Directors, 1794 Veterinary Dispensaries manned by  Veterinary Assistant Surgeons and 2916 Rural Livestock Units at Village level  manned by Para Vets are functioning.
There  are 22 Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratories are functioning, one each at  district headquarters with facilities for disease investigation, quick  diagnosis and for mapping out diseases to render timely and effective control  measures.  These are the district  referral laboratories for effective diagnosis and vaccine distribution work.

Artificial          Insemination in cattle and buffaloes
Q.1          :
What          is the importance of Artificial Insemination (AI)?
A          :
AI          is the technique in which semen is collected from the superior bulls          and introduced into female reproductive tract at proper time with the          help of instruments. The major advantage of AI over natural mating is          that it permits the dairy farmer to use top proven sires for genetic          improvement of his herd and control of venereal diseases. AI is also of          tremendous value in making optimal use of different sires and enables          dairy farmer to breed individual cows to selected sires according to          their breeding goal.
Q.2          :
What          should be the weight and age of cows and buffalo heifers at the time of          AI?
The          weight and age of cow heifer should be 15-18 months and 275-300 Kg and          that of buffalo heifers should be 26-30 months, 300-325 Kg at the time          of first AI.
Q.3          :
How          the animals can be detected in heat?
The          animals should be watched carefully for heat symptoms for half an hour          atleast in the morning (5-7 AM) and evening (between 8-10 PM). The          common heat symptoms in dairy animals are mounting behavior, mucus          discharge from genitalia, restlessness, swelling of vulva, loss of          appetite, bellowing, frequent urination and fall in milk yield.
Q.4          :
How          the quality of semen can be assured?
Quality          semen should be procured from the well established breeding centers and          stored properly in liquid nitrogen containers. These containers should          be regularly watched for gas level. The semen should be thawed at          30-35oC for 30 sec just before loading to AI gun and insemination.          Loaded gun should be protected from direct sun light and hygienic          conditions should be maintained during AI.
Q.5          :
What          is the ideal time of AI?
As          a thumb rule, animals coming in heat in the morning should be          inseminated in the same evening and those coming in heat in the evening          should be inseminated in the next morning. The animals remaining in          heat for 24-36 hour should be inseminated 12-18 hrs after the onset of          heat symptoms at least two times at an interval of 12 hrs apart.
Q.6          :
What          is the ideal time for animal to get pregnant after calving?
Following          parturition the cow or buffalo should conceive between 80-100 days to          maintain the calving interval of nearly one year.
Q.7          :
What          is the ideal time for pregnancy diagnosis after insemination?
The          inseminated cow or buffalo not showing heat symptoms should be examined          for pregnancy diagnosis two months after the AI.

Breeding solutions:
Conception failure        or infertility
Q.1 :
Why a cow/buffalo fails to get        pregnant after repeated services/inseminations?
A :
This could be due to:
Uterine             infections
Hormonal             aberrations
Nutritional             deficiencies
Wrong             time of AI and use of poor quality semen
Q.2 :
Why some cows show heat symptom for        5-6 days?
This could be due to hormonal imbalance        leading to delayed ovulation or formation of follicular cyst on the        ovary. To diagnose the condition, the animal needs to be examined by        veterinarian for status of genital organs particularly ovaries.        Ultrasonography of ovaries and hormonal analysis of blood is also carried        to diagnosis the condition and to decide line of treatment.
Q.3 :
Why a cow/buffalo is not cured for        dirty discharge even after intrauterine medications?
The cervico-vaginal mucus discharge        of that animal should be tested for microbial isolation and drug        sensitivity test. Depending upon the report, the treatment should be        done.
Q.4 :
What is the relation of post service        bleeding & conception?
This type of bleeding is normal        physiological in some of crossbred cows and is known as metestral        bleeding. There is no relationship between metestral bleeding and        conception failure. Rather this is a positive sign indicating that the        animal has ovulated. The animal needs to be examined thoroughly to find        the exact cause of conception failure.
Q.5 :
What are the causes of abortions in        cattle & buffalo?
Abortion can occur in dairy animals due to following        causes:
Deficiency             of progesterone in early gestation.
Bacterial,             viral and protozoan infections e.g. Brucellosis, Leptospirosis,             Vibriosis, IBR– IPV, Trichomoniasis.
Feeding             of toxic plants and fungus infested feed.
High             fever.
Injury             to the abdomen.
Misuse             of drugs/hormones.
Infected             animal should be segregated and handled separately away from the             healthy animals.
Q.6 :
What is anestrus?
It is the inability of the animal to        show signs of heat due to inactive ovaries. It can be of different types        like true anestrus, summer anestrus, postpartum anestrus and silent heat
Q.7 :
What are the main causes of anestrus?
The different causes of anestrus are        poor nutrition, hormonal imbalance, infectious diseases, anatomical        defects, lactation, suckling and poor management.
Q.8 :
Why do some animals fail to come into        heat for long period after parturition?
This problem is more common in high        yielding animals because a lot of energy is required for the parturition        process as well as production after delivery. So animal looses weight.        Therefore, good management through proper nutrition is required to meet        the energy status of the animal and restore the reproductive performance        of high yielding dairy animals.
Q.9 :
Why dairy animals especially        buffaloes do not show estrus in summer season?
The main reason is due to heat stress        and lack of green fodder availability. Farmers are advised to reduce        stress by keeping animals in shady areas especially under trees,        providing fans/coolers and clean drinking water facilities in the shed.        Provision of green fodder (Hay/silage can be used as an alternative in        summer months) and allowing the animals for wallowing in ponds especially        to buffaloes are also helpful to reduce the effect of summer stress.
Q.10 :
In certain buffaloes some mucus        discharge is observed however, no prominent signs of
In this condition the animal has        functional ovaries, comes in heat regularly but it does not show the        external behavioral signs of heat. Animal is usually cyclic and the owner        should go for mating of their animals. Farmers are also advised to keep a        close observation on the affected animals.
Q.11 :
Should hormonal therapy be used for        onset of estrus?
Hormones are effective only if the        nutrition is balanced. Therefore, farmers are advised to check the        nutrition of their animals regularly, before giving any other treatment.        The hormonal treatment should always be administered in consultation with        veterinary doctor.
Q.12 :
Most buffalo heifers do not come in        estrus at less than 3 years of age?
Generally such animals have a poor        body weight. Normal body weight should be around 275 300 kg in case of        buffalo heifers for onset of estrus. Therefore, feed good balanced diet        as well as go for deworming of animals in order to have early onset of        estrus.
HEAT DETECTION DEMANDS TIME AND ATTENTION FOR SUCCESSFUL A.I.  PROGRAM
Heat (estrus) is simply the period of time when a  cow or heifer is sexually receptive and signals that an egg, ready to be  fertilized, is about to be released. It normally occurs every 18 to 24 days. In  a natural breeding program, the bull is the one that determines when a cow is  in heat. In an AI program, you make the decisions.

Silent Heat Problems
Solutions to Overcome  Silent Heat Problem
Heat Detection
The animal becomes  restless, sometimes separating itself from the rest of the herd, walking along  fences to seek a bull.
The animal tries to  mount other animals, sniffs them and is sniffed at by others (see figure)
The animal bellows in  order to attract a bull (the Zebu does not do this).
Standing heat: the cow  stands still when she is mounted by other animals (standing is the only  reliable practical test of heat, see figure).
Signs that the animal  has been mounted by others, such as mud on its flanks, bare patches of skin on  the hook or the pin bone, ruffled hair on the back etc. (see figure).
The lips of the vulva  turn red and are somewhat swollen (see figure).
There is a discharge of  clear, thin mucus hanging from the vulva or adhering to the tail (see figure).
The average heat period lasts about 11 hours, so in order  to detect heat you should check the cows at least 3 times a day: early in the  morning, in the afternoon and late in the evening (spend about 20 minutes each  time). Cows should be calm (not distracted by feeding or so).

Mastitis in dairy animals
Q.1 :
What is mastitis?
A :
Mastitis is inflammation of udder/ mammary gland characterized    by change in milk.
Q.2 :
What should I do after onset of Mastitis?
If it is possible, milk sample for culture sensitivity test    (CST) (to know the sensitive antibiotics) should be submitted before starting    treatment. Broad spectrum antibiotic and supportive treatment with    consultation of veterinarian should be given to the animal. If antibiotics    are already being given to the animal, the milk sample should be submitted 4    days after end of therapy.
Q.3 :
How should I take the milk sample for    testing to the laboratory?
You should collect the milk sample in sterilized test tubes or    in sterilized vials. The test tube should be labeled appropriately. At least    5 ml of milk sample should be submitted to the laboratory as early as    possible. If delay is expected, samples should be kept in ice-container.    Udder should be cleaned and soaked with neat piece of cloth. Teat orifice    should aseptically be cleaned. Before taking sample in test tube, first few    strippings (1-2 strippings) should be discarded.
Q.4 :
What should I do to avoid infection    during dry period?
As there is no specific dry cow therapy available in India, one    should take care of the managemental aspects. If prevalence of infection in    the herd is high, all the animals at drying- off should be injected with Intra-mammary    infusions.
Q.5 :
What should I do to avoid recurrence of    mastitis?
Individual animal should be treated and her udder immunity    enhanced by using mineral mixture of standard quality, cleaning of udder    before milking, milking of infected teat at the end and teat dipping after    milking.. Milk samples should be tested regularly after 15 days using SLS    paddle test. The positive animal’s milk samples should be tested for CST in    the laboratory. Treatment of sub-clinical case is more desirable.
Q.6 :
Why does the swelling of udder occur just    after calving while there was no sign during late pregnancy?
There are chances of subclinical mastitis at drying-off and    during dry period. This infection gets flared-up after parturition due to    certain stress factors.
Q.7 :
What is the treatment of udder/teat    fibrosis?
Udder/ teat fibrosis occurs as a result of chronic infection.    Treatment of udder and teat fibrosis in that particular lactation can result    into resolution to some extent, but chances of recovery may be expected in    the next lactation when new lacteal tissue formation will ensue.
Q.8 :
There is problem of warts over the teat    of animals. How to treat it?
Please, Consult nearest available qualified veterinarian for    treatment.
Q.9 :
I have a buffalo which has developed    sores at the base of teat since one month. Milk yield is normal. Advise me    appropriate treatment.
This problem is usually chronic running for many months. The    best treatment for this is to apply antiseptic solutions like Betadine/Povidine    regularly. If no recovery occurs apply a powder mixed in equal parts    containing boric acid, kaolin and zinc oxide once daily. The healing in such    cases is slow and takes 3-4 weeks. Do not use antibiotics, which will    increases the cost of treatment only.
Q.10 :
What are the mastitis control measures?
The important features of a successful mastitis control    programme are:
Regular testing    of animals for subclinical mastitis
Adopt hygiene    measures
Post-milking teat    dipping be adopted
Follow Dry cow    therapy
Increase udder    resistance to mastitis
Q.11 :
What is Post-milking teat dipping?
The teats of all the lactating cows and dry cows (during first    10-14 days of dry period) are dipped regularly after every milking in a    germicidal solution. The recommended teat dips are
Iodine (0.5%) solution 6 parts         + Glycerine 1 part
Chlorhexidine (0.5%) solution 1         Litre + Glycerine 60 ml
The iodine teat dip is the best as it treats various types of    teat lesions and injuries also.

Mineral deficiency
What is Hematuria?.
It is the presence of blood in urine and can be due to many    reasons like phosphorus deficiency, Babesia infection, etc.
What is  leucoderma ?
It is associated with copper deficiency.
What are the clinical signs of copper    deficiency?
The clinical signs are as follows:
Unthriftiness
Change in hair colour or         leucoderma
Anaemia
Chronic diarrhoea
Chronic lameness
Neonatal ataxia
How we can diagnose and treat the copper    deficiency?
We can diagnose the copper deficiency by low serum and hepatic    copper concentration and response to treatment. Copper deficiency can be    treated by oral administration of copper sulphate or inj. copper glycnate .    Consult any nearest available veterinarian for this purpose.
My cow calved last night and is now    unable to get up.
Many times high yielder cows suffer from milk fever after    parturition which is due to calcium deficiency. Following calcium treatment,    there is quick recovery.
What is the management of hyperthermia?
Give bath to the animals (4-5         times/day) during summer.
Feed during early hours of the         day
Contact a qualified         veterinarian for the treatment, if infections are suspected
Hyperthermia in farm animals
What are the common causes of high body    temperature (hyperthermia) in cattle during summer season?
Infectious diseases like         haemorrhagic septicaemia, foot and mouth disease and black quarter etc.
Haemoprotozoan diseases like         Anaplasmosis, Theileriosis and Babesiosis besides high environmental         temperature are common causes of high rise in body temperature during         summer season.
What are the clinical signs of    hyperthermia?
High fever (1050-1070F)
Panting
Marked decrease in appetite
Loss of milk yield
Temperature is normal in early         hours of the day but as the day temperature rises body temperature of         animal also increases.
Flourosis in dairy animals
Does excess fluoride is also harmful for    animals?
Yes. Excess fluoride intake can produce harmful effects in    animals also, though clinical signs may be absent in mild cases. Flourosis is    common in animals reared in district Mansa, Bathinda, Ferozpur and Sangrur.
What are different clinical signs of    fluorosis?
Clinical signs of fluorosis include changes in teeth and    bones. Teeth become brown-blackish and loose. Bones become weak and prone to    fracture. The animal shows weakness, lameness, reduced appetite and weight    loss.
What are different sources of excess    fluoride for animals?
Water containing excessive fluoride concentration is the major    source. Poor quality mineral mixture or dust coming out from brick kilns or    other industry are other sources.
Is fluorosis fully curable?
No. Changes in bone and teeth are irreversible and can not be    fully cured. However, animals sufferings can be reduced after treatment.
How fluorosis can be prevented or    treated?
Remove sources of excess fluoride. Do not give deep bore well    water; rather give water from ponds (surface water). Give calcium carbonate    or good quality mineral mixture after consulting the veterinarian.
Impaction in dairy animals
Why impaction is very much prevalent in    dairy animals?
It is due to lack of green fodder in diet or giving excess Jowar/maize    straw(Kutti). Ingestion of sharp metallic foreign bodies in cattle and    buffalo may also be responsible.
What should be done to avoid impaction in    cattle and buffaloes?
Feed green fodder mixed in Kutti throughout the year. Avoid    access of animals to nails, needles, wires and sharp farm equipment parts    etc.
What is first aid before reaching    hospital?
Tie and confine the animal to one place. Make available ample    of drinking water throughout the day and seek the advice of veterinarian as    soon as possible.
Lameness in dairy animals
Whether there is any affect on    reproduction/fertility?
Yes, due to pain animal does not express signs of heat. It is    related with reproduction failure.
How farmers can control/ check lameness?
Always undertake hoof trimming         every six months.
Always feed mineral mixture         regularly.
Take the help of a qualified         veterinary doctor if problem is severe/clinical.
Contact  your nearest Veterinary Doctor if the         problem is consistent or persistant.
Deworming and vaccination
What are the common diseases prevalent in    Punjab against which we should go for    vaccination?
Animals should be vaccinated for Foot and Mouth disease (FMD),    Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (H S), Black Quarter(BQ) and brucellosis. Consult    the veterinarian for this purpose regularly.
Precautions to be taken while vaccinating    the animals?
Vaccines should be procured from reliable source. Cold chain    should be maintained from purchase of vaccine till its administration. Don’t    put vaccine in direct heat and sunlight.
At what age we should start deworming in    our animals.
At the age of < 1 month we should start deworming.
Miscellaneous
There is serious problem of ticks in our    animals. How to control it.
Apply Butox/Taktic/Cypermethrin @ 3ml/liter of water over the    body of affected animals. The same solution should be sprayed in the animal    premises. Avoid spraying the medicine in mangers. Animal should not lick the    medicine during application.
There is problem of blood in milk    recently after parturition. What is the treatment for  it ?
Some time it is physiological and automatically resolves    within few days. Milk sample can also be sent to the mastitis lab. In the    department of Clinical Veterinary Medicine for cultural sensitivity    examination.
My buffalo is suffering from diarrhea    from last two months. Initially diarrhea was intermittent. Milk yield and    appetite is normal.
Get the dung sample tested for worms and a disease known as    “Johne’s disease”. If the report shows Johne’s disease, isolate the animal so    that feeding and watering of the animals is not with other animals.
There is problem of diarrhea in calves at    our farm. What should be done to control/minimize it ?
New born calf should be fed first milk “colostrum” within 6-12    hour after birth @ 10% of the body weight of the calf. Calves should be kept    in comfortable environment. Clean the calf shed daily with Chlorasol    disinfectant or any other suitable disinfectant. Diarrheic calves should be    kept separate from healthy calves. Diarrheic calves should be treated with    parenteral/oral fluids, antibiotics, herbal antidiarrheals under the    supervision of a veterinarian.
Milk yield of the cow has been reduced    for the past few days. How to increase it?
First of all send the milk sample to Vety Hospital for    diagnosis of infection in the udder. After that deworm the animal with broad    spectrum dewormers like albendazole, fenbendazole, ivermectin to make the    animal free from endoparasites in consultation with the Veterinarian. Provide    good quality feed including green fodder, concentrate and mineral mixture as    per the milk yield of the animal.
Veterinary Toxicology
What should be done if an animal has    consumed a poisonous substance?
If an animal is suspected of consuming something poisonous,    local veterinarian should be contacted/consulted immediately. Samples can be    submitted in the lab by qualified veterinarians only.
Which are the potentially harmful    substances that can poison the animals?
Medicines including pain         killers, cold and flu preparations and antidepressants.
Insecticides such as flea and         tick preparations and insect baits. Some species of animals can be         particularly sensitive to certain types of insecticides, so it is vital         to follow label instructions exactly.
Common household cleaners such         as bleaches, detergents and disinfectants that may cause         gastrointestinal distress and irritation to the skin, eyes or         respiratory tract.
What information should be collected    while investigating a toxicity case?
During toxicological investigations, the following information    can be of utmost help:
The number of animals in a         herd/group that may have been exposed.
The number of animals         exhibiting toxicity symptoms or lethality.
The species/breed of affected         animals along with their age, sex and pregnancy status.
The clinical signs exhibited by         the animals viz. body temperature, color of stool, blood and urine,         physical condition and neurological symptoms.
History of feeding patterns of         the animal along with any previous ailments.
Circumstantial evidence should         also be obtained for ruling out any malicious causes of poisoning.
What are the symptoms/signs of nitrate    toxicity in cattle?
In acute nitrate poisoning, the cattle are often observed to be    normal one day and dead the next day. This occurs within 30 minutes to 4    hours of ingestion of plants high in nitrates. Initial signs include    salivation followed by frequent urination. These are followed by difficult    breathing, increased respiratory rate and dark brown or "chocolate"    colored blood and mucous membranes. The animals become weak and reluctant to    move and may exhibit convulsions before death. Exposed pregnant cattle    usually abort soon after recovering.
What are the main causes of nitrate    toxicosis?
The most important cause of nitrate/nitrite toxicity is the    presence of high levels of nitrates (or nitrites) in the feed or water. These    compounds are converted to nitrites in the rumen of cattle, which are    absorbed across the rumen wall into the blood stream. The nitrite in blood    reacts with hemoglobin to form a compound, methemoglobin, which lacks the    oxygen-carrying capacity. Thus, the animal dies because of oxygen deficit to    the vital organs of the body.
Where do the nitrates come from?
Nitrates are concentrated in water sources from fertilizer    run-offs, decaying organic matter, animal wastes or other sources of    nitrogen. The nitrates are generally higher after periods of excess runoff    after fertilization or after heavy rainfalls. Occasionally, deep, drilled    wells can have high levels of nitrates. In addition, certain weeds such as    Johnson grass and nightshade are also high in nitrates. Almost any crop can    have high nitrate levels however, Sudan grass hay and oat hay are    more likely to have levels of nitrates that are potentially toxic.
When is the nitrate toxicity suspected?
Nitrate toxicity problem should be suspected in cases of acute    animal death after a recent change in feeding practices (oat hay, Sudan grass    hay, etc), change in water supply, moving from one field to another, etc.    However, differential diagnosis should be done ruling out other common causes    of acute death in cattle, such as red water disease, anaplasmosis and other    toxicities. For confirmation of nitrate toxicity, rumen samples, feed samples    as well as water samples are routinely analyzed.
What is the treatment of nitrate    toxicity?
The animal should be provided veterinary aid immediately. The    antidote for nitrate toxicity is methylene blue, a chemical that restores the    hemoglobin content of blood. However, the efficacy of this antidote is higher    if administered in the early stages of toxicosis. The survival rate is    indirectly proportional to the time spent in seeking veterinary aid.
How can nitrate toxicity be prevented?
Under normal circumstance, animals usually do not consume    weeds high in nitrate content. These weeds are taken up by animals only    during periods of drought or due to lack of quality forage. Therefore,    thorough testing of feed and water is essential in drought and high-risk    areas. In addition, animals should be exposed to these forages gradually over    a period of time.
What are the main routes of exposure to    pesticides in animals?
Animals can be exposed to pesticides either by absorption    through the skin or eyes (dermally), through the mouth (orally) or through    the lungs (inhalation).
Which are the most commonly used    insecticides?
Pesticide poisoning cases usually involve either    organophosphate or carbamate insecticides. Some commonly used organophosphate    and carbamate insecticides are enlisted below: Organophosphates Carbamates    Malathion Sevin Parathion Carbaryl Chlorpyrifos Carbofuran Monocrotophos    Triazophos Fenamiphos
Q.12 :
What are some common signs associated    with organophosphate or carbamate insecticide poisoning?
Mild exposures
fatigue, dizziness, loss of         appetite, diarrhea
blurred vision associated with         excessive lacrimation
contracted eye pupils
excessive sweating and         salivation
slow heart beat (< 50         per minute)
rippling of surface muscles         just under the skin.
Moderately severe
is unable to walk;
exhibits marked constriction of         the pupils (pinpoint pupils);
exhibits muscle twitching;
has involuntary urination and         bowel movement.
Severe poisonings
Q.13 :
Which pyrethroid insecticides are    commonly used in agriculture and Veterinary Practices?
Some of the commonly used pyrethroid insecticides are:
Q.14 :
What should be done in a suspected case    of pesticide poisoning in animals?
A veterinarian should be immediately consulted and the    following information should be made available:
Trade name of the pesticide         ingested/inhaled.
Estimated amount of toxin         ingested.
Time lapsed since the ingestion         of poison
Signs of toxicity produced -         vomition, salivation, convulsions etc.
Gross observations - such as         color of gums, respiratory rate, heart rate, body temperature.
Q.15 :
What is the need to mix whole blood tubes    or separate the serum immediately after collection?
The EDTA or heparin added in whole blood tubes to prevent    blood clotting does not automatically blend with the blood, so unmixed    samples will still clot. During cold weather or if packed in ice, clots in    serum tubes will hemolyze, thus altering test results.
Q.16 :
Which are the plants that are toxic to    animals and shouldn’t be kept around the house?
The common plants which are poisonous to animals are:
Lantana
Oleander/ Kaner
Lilies
Castor Bean
Marijuana
Kalanchoe
Sago Palm
Amaryllis
Tulip
Datura
Azalea/ Rhododendron
Chrysanthemum
Q.17 :
What are the most common food hazards for    the pets?
The following foods should never be given to pet animals:
Alcoholic beverages
Chocolate (all forms)
Coffee (all forms)
Fatty foods
Nuts, Moldy or spoiled foods
Onions, onion powder
Raisins and grapes
Salt, Yeast dough, Garlic

Reduced or no feed and water intake, dullness, rough body    coat, fever, diarrhea, loss of production (milk, meat/wool etc.), and    presence of vectors/intermediate hosts.
How to diagnose these various parasitic    diseases?
For diagnosis of the parasitic infections/infestations    examination of faecal, blood and skin scrapings is necessary. This should be    done in a well equipped laboratory viz. Department of Veterinary Parasitology    (Ph.: 0161-2414029) and Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory, Teaching Veterinary    Clinical Complex (Ph.: 0161-2414052).
How to send the samples for diagnosis of    various parasitic diseases?
Blood should be sent well mixed in EDTA or methanol fixed    blood smear can be sent; faeces should be sent in 10% formalin and skin    scrapings in 10% potassium hydroxide solution. With any one of the above    sample, information like type of animal; age of animal; sex of animal;    clinical symptoms etc should be provided.
What are the clinical signs of (surra)    and what is the causative organism?
Surra is caused by a blood protozoa, Trypanasoma evansi and    the signs are as follows: Horse: Intermittent fever, emaciation, oedema    varying from urticarial plaques on the neck and flanks to legs and lower    parts of the body, haemorrhages at the junction of skin and mucus membrane    especially at nostrils, eyes and anus.

What are the measures to control snail    borne diseases?
Ponds/lakes etc. should be cleaned from time to time and    fenced.
Animals should not be allowed         to drink water from snail contaminated ponds/lakes etc.
Dung of animals should be put         in dung pits, to destroy the eggs of trematode parasites.
Number of snails can be reduced         by fishes, crabs, ducks etc. which feed on these snails.
Herbal control by plant         extracts of Neem, Aak, Datura and Safeda etc.

Mange is a contagious skin disease caused by parasitic mites.    Commonly sarcoptic, psoroptic and demodectic (or red mange) mange is seen in    cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat, dog etc.
How to control mange?
Isolate the affected animals         from other animals
Thoroughly clean their bedding         and sheds.
Treat the affected animals by         chemotherapy viz use of ivermectin, topical application of formamidines         etc is effective.
Q.18 :
What is pediculosis?
The term pediculosis is used to denote lice infestation in    animals and birds.
Q.19 :
What are the effects of lice on their    hosts?
Irritation, restlessness, self inflicted injury, reduced    feeding, inappropriate sleep and production loss.
Q.20 :
How to control pediculosis?
In poultry, control is achieved by dusts or sprays of carbaryl    or coumaphos, toxaphene, hexachlorocyclohexane, melathion etc. In cattle or    large ruminants, crotoxyphos, coumaphos, cruformate, farphur, ronnel,    cypermethrin, malathion etc spray is effective.
Q.21 :
What are the parasitic diseases    transmitted by fleas?
Fleas act as vector the diseases like Dipylium caninum,    Dipetalonema reconditum etc.

Management Practices in  turkey
I. Incubation
The incubation period is 28 days      in turkey. There are two methods of incubation.
(a) Natural        incubation with broody hens:
Naturally          turkeys are good brooders and the broody hen can hatch 10-15 numbers of          eggs. Only clean eggs with good eggshell and shape should be placed for          brooding to get 60-80% hatchability and healthy young ones.
(b) Artificial        Incubation:
In          artificial incubation, eggs are hatched with the help of incubators.          The temperature and relative humidity in setter and hatcher are as          follows:
Temperature (Degree F)
Relative humidity (%)
Setter            99.5
61-63
Hatcher            99.5
85-90
Egg          should be turned at hourly intervals daily. Eggs should be collected          frequently to prevent soiling and breakage and also to get better          hatchability.
II. Brooding
In turkey 0-4 weeks period is      called as brooding period. However, in winter brooding period is extended      upto 5-6 weeks. As a thumb rule the turkey young ones need double hover      space as compared to chicken. Brooding day old young ones can be done using      infra red bulbs or gas brooder and traditional brooding systems.
Points to be        noted during brooding:
The floor space               requirement for 0-4 weeks is 1.5 sq.ft. per bird.
The brooder house               should be made ready atleast two days before the arrival of young               ones
The litter material               should be spread in a circular manner with a diameter of 2 mtrs.
To prevent the young               ones from wandering away from source of heat, a fence of atleast 1               feet height must be provided
Starting temperature is               950F followed by weekly reduction of 50F per week upto 4 weeks of               age
Shallow waterers should               be used.
The          average mortality rate is 6-10% during the first four weeks of life.          Young ones by nature are reluctant to eat and drink in the first few          days of life, primarily because of bad eyesight and nervousness. Hence,          they have to be force fed.
Force Feeding
Starve          out problem is one of the major factors for early mortality in young          ones. So special care has to be taken for supplying feed and water. In          force feeding, milk should be fed at the rate of 100ml per liter of          water and one boiled egg have to be given at the rate of one per 10          young ones up to fifteen days. This will compensate the protein and          energy requirements of the young ones.
Litter materials
The          common litter materials used for brooding are wood shavings saw dust,          paddy husk, chopped saw etc. The thickness of the litter material          should be 2 inch at the beginning and may be increased to 3-4 inch in          course of time by gradual addition. The litter should be turned over at          frequent intervals to prevent caking.
III. Rearing systems
Turkeys can be reared under free      range or intensive system.
A. Free range        system of rearing
Advantages:
It reduces the feed               cost by fifty percent.
Low investment.
Cost benefit ratio is               high.
In          the free range system, in one acre of fenced land we can rear 200-250          adult turkeys. Shelter should be provided during night at the rate of          3-4 sq.ft. per bird. They should be protected from predators during          scavenging. Planting of trees is desirable for providing shade and          cooler environment. The range should be rotated which will help to          reduce incidence of parasite infestation.
Free          range feeding:
Health          cover:
B. Intensive system        of rearing
Improved production               efficiency.
Better management and               disease control.
Housing:
Housing protects               turkeys form sun, rain, wind, predators and provides comfort.
In hotter parts of the               country the long axis of the house should run from East to West.
The distance between               two houses should be at least 20 meters and the young stock house               should be at least 50 to 100 meters away from the adult house.
The width of the open               house should not exceed 9 meters.
The height of the house               may vary from 2.6 to 3.3 meters from the floor to roof.
An overhang of one               meter should be provided to avoid the rainwater splash.
The floor of the houses               should be cheap, durable and safe preferably concrete with               moisture proof.
When          turkeys are reared under deep litter system, the general managemental          conditions are similar to that of chicken but care should be taken to          provide adequate floor, waterer and feeder space to accommodate the          large bird.
IV. Catching and    handling of turkeys
Turkeys of all age group can be      easily driven from one place to another with the help of a stick. For      catching turkeys a darkened room is best, wherein they can be picked up      with both legs without any injury. However, mature turkeys should not be      kept hanging for more than 3-4 minutes.

The temperament of turkeys is      usually nervous; hence they get panicky at all stages. Hence entry of      visitors in to the turkey’s house should be restricted.
VI. Debeaking
Young ones should be debeaked to      control feather picking and cannibalism. Debeaking can be done at day old      or 3-5 weeks of age. Remove the beak at about one half the distance from      nostril to the tip of the beak.
VII. Desnooding
Removal of the snood or dewbill      (the fleshy protuberance near the base of the beak) is to prevent the head      injuries from picking and fighting. At the day old the snood can be removed      by finger pressure. At 3 weeks of age it can be cut off close to the head      with sharp scissors.
VIII. Detoeing or    toe clipping:
Clipping is done at day old by      removing the tip of the toe just to the inside of the outer most toe pad      including the entire toenail.
IX. Feed
The methods of feeding are mash      feeding and pellet feeding.
The energy, protein,           vitamin and mineral requirements for turkeys are high when compared to           chicken.
Since the energy and           protein requirements for the both sexes vary they must be reared           separately for better results.
Feed should be given in           feeders and not on the ground.
Whenever change is made           from one diet to another it should be carried out gradually.
Turkeys require a constant           and clean water supply at all times.
Provide more number of           waterers during summer.
Feed turkeys during the           cooler parts of the day during summer.
Provide shell grit at the           rate of 30-40 gm per day per bird to avoid the leg weakness.
Green feeding
In          intensive system, greens can be fed upto 50% of the total diet on dry          mash basis. Fresh Lucerne is first class green feed for turkeys of all          ages. Apart from the Desmanthus and Stylo can be chopped and fed          turkeys to reduce the feed cost.

X. Breeding    practices
Natural mating:
The          mating behavior of adult male tom is known as Strut, wherein it spreads          the wings and makes a peculiar sound frequently. In natural mating, the          male: female ratio is 1:5 for medium type turkeys and 1:3 for large          types. On an average 40-50 young ones is expected from each adult          female. Adult males are rarely used for mating after first year due to          reduced fertility. There is a tendency in adult males to develop          affinity towards a particular female, so we have to change the adult          males for every 15 days.
Artificial        insemination:
The          advantage of artificial insemination is to maintain high fertility from          turkey flock through out the season.
Collection of        semen from adult male
The age of tom should               be 32-36 weeks for semen collection.
The tom should be kept               in isolation at least 15 days before semen collection.
The tom should be               handled regularly and the time required to collect the semen is 2               minutes.
As the toms are               sensitive to handling, the same operator should be used to get               maximum volume of semen.
Average semen volume is               0.15 to 0.30ml.
Use the semen within               one hour of collection.
Take the collection               three times weekly or on alternative days.
Insemination in        hens:
Artificial insemination               is done when the flock attains 8-10% egg production.
Inseminate the hens               every three weeks with 0.025-0.030ml of undiluted semen.
After 12 weeks of the               season it may be better to inseminate every fortnight.
Inseminate the hen               after 5-6’ O clock in the evening.
The average fertility               should be 80-85% over a 16 week breeding season.

Marketing of turkeys
The body weight of adult male      and adult female turkey at the 16th week is 7.26 kg and 5.53kg. This is      optimum weight for marketing the turkeys.
Turkey egg:
The turkey will start               lay from the 30th week of age and its production period is 24               weeks from the point of lay.
Under proper feeding               and artificial lightening management turkey hens lay as much as               60-100 eggs annually.
Nearly 70 percent of               the eggs will be laid in the afternoon.
The turkey eggs are               tinted and weigh about 85 gms.
Egg is noticeably               pointed at one end with strong shell.
The protein, lipid               carbohydrate and mineral content of turkey egg are 13.1%,               11.8%,1.7% and 0.8% respectively. The cholesterol is 15.67-23.97               mg/gm of yolk.
Turkey meat:
People          prefer turkey meat because of its leanest nature. The protein, fat,          energy value of turkey meat are 24%,6.6%, 162 Calories per 100 gm of          meat. Mineral like potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, selenium, zinc          and sodium are present. It is also rich in essential amino acids and          vitamins like niacin, vitamin B6 and B12. It is rich in unsaturated          fatty acids and essential fatty acids and low in cholesterol.

Rabbit Farming
Why Rabbit Farming?
With available small           investment and in a small place rabbit farming gives more income
Rabbits eat ordinary feed           and convert them into a protein rich high quality meat
Apart from meat production           they can also be reared for hide and fur

Rabbit Farming is    for whom?
For landless farmers, uneducated      youth and women, rabbit farming gives an additional income as a part time      job
Advantages of Rabbit    Farming
By rabbit rearing one can           produce a quality protein rich meat for his own family
Rabbits can be fed with           easily available leaves, waste vegetables, grains available in the           home
Growth rate in broiler           rabbits is very high. They attain 2 kgs at the age of three months
Litter size (Number of           young ones born/ kindling) in rabbits is high (around 8-12)
When compared to the other           meats rabbit meat contain high protein (21%) and less fat (8%). So           this meat is suitable for all age groups from adults to children

Methods of rearing    rabbits
Rabbits can be reared at the      backyard with in a small shed which can be constructed with a small      investment. To protect rabbits from the climatic conditions such as in hot      summer, rain and to protect them from dogs, cats construction of shed is      necessary.
Deep litter system
This          method is suitable for rearing small number of rabbits. To prevent          rabbits to dig burrows the floor the floor should be made up of          concrete. The Litter materials such as paddy husk, paddy straw or wood          shavings can be filled up to 4-6 inches from the floor. Deep litter          system is not suitable for rearing more than 30 rabbits. Male rabbits          should be housed separately. This type of housing is not suitable for          intensive system of rearing. Rabbits reared in deep litter system are          more susceptible to diseases. Management of bunnies also very difficult          in deep litter system.

Points to be remembered in      feeding management of rabbits
The teeth of rabbits are           continuously growing. Therefore rearing rabbits with concentrate feed           alone is impossible
The time schedule for           feeding should be maintained strictly. If there is late in feeding of           rabbits, they become restless and which in turn reduces the body           weight
Due the high temperature in           the day time the rabbits won’t take feed during day time. But they           active during night. Therefore the green fodder fed to rabbits at night           time will helps the rabbits to consume the green fodder with out           wastage. Because of this the concentrate feed should be given in the           morning time
Concentrate feed can be           given in the form of pellets. If pellet feed is not available the           concentrate feed mixed with water and made in to small balls and given           to rabbits
For 1 kg rabbit 40 grams of           concentrate feed and 40 grams of green fodder should be given for one           day
Rabbits always fed with           fresh green fodder. The green fodder should not be put on the floor of           the cages but they can be inserted in the sides of the cages
Clean fresh water should be           provided to rabbits during all times of the day

Breeding Management    of rabbits
Breeding age
Female rabbits- 5-6               months
Male rabbits- 5-6               months (Even though the male rabbits mature at the age of 5-6               months they should be used for breeding at the age of one year to               get the quality younger rabbits)
Selection of        rabbits for breeding
Rabbits can be selected               at the age of 5-8 months after attaining adult body weight
Male and female rabbits               should be selected for breeding from the high litter size
Healthy rabbits only               selected for breeding. Healthy rabbits are active and the feed and               water intake is usually normal. Apart from this they keep their               body clean. The hair of the healthy rabbits is usually clean, soft               and shiny
While selecting male               rabbits for breeding with the above characters they should have               two well descended testes in their scrotum
During selection of               male rabbits they allowed to mate with a female rabbit to know the               breeding capability
Oestrous signs or        heat signs in female rabbits
There          is no specific oestrous cycle period in rabbits. Whenever the female          rabbits allow the male rabbit for mating then the female rabbit is in          oestrous. Some times if a female rabbit is in heat, its vulva is          congested. When a male rabbit is kept near to a female rabbit in heat          or oestrous, the female rabbit shows depression of its back and raising          of its behind portion of the body. At the same time if the female          rabbit is not in heat it will go the corner of the cage and attack the          male.

The          female rabbits showing the signs of heat or oestrous taken to the male          rabbit’s cage. If the female rabbit is in correct time of oestrous that          used to lift her tail and allow the male rabbit to mate with her. After          successful mating the male rabbit fall on one side and make a specific          sound. One male rabbit should not be utilised for not more than 3 or 4          days in a week. Similarly a male rabbit should not be utilised for          breeding not more than 2-3 times per day. The breeding male rabbits          should be given adequate rest and good nutrition. In a rabbitry there          should be one male rabbit for 10 female rabbits. One or two male          rabbits can also be additionally reared in the farm and they can be          used if the rabbits used for breeding become sick.
Care of Pregnant        female
After          the pregnancy diagnosis was done, the pregnant rabbits should be fed          with increased quantity of concentrate feed from 100g to 150g excess          than the normal feeding. The pregnant rabbit should be transferred to          the kindling cage on 25 days after mating. Five days before the          expected date of mating nest box should be kept in the kindling cage.          Dried coconut fibre or paddy straw is used as bedding material in the          nest box. The pregnant rabbit pluck the hair in their abdomen and form          a nest for the young ones one or two days before kindling. During this          period the rabbit should not be disturbed and persons from outside          should not allowed near the kindling cage.
Care and management        of newborn rabbits
During          birth newborn rabbits eyes are closed and they don’t have hair on their          body. All new born rabbits are usually lying in the bedding material          formed by the dam in the nest box. Usually the dam gives milk to the          young ones one time a day in the early morning. If we compulsorily make          the rabbit to feed her young ones there won’t be no milk secretion at          all. The skin of those new born rabbits received the adequate quantity          of milk from their mother is usually shiny. But the skin of those          newborn rabbits who has not received the adequate quantity of milk from          their mother is dry and wrinkled in appearance and their body          temperature is low and they look lazy.
Step mother feeding
Generally          a female rabbit has 8-12 teats in her udder. When the litter size is          more than the number of teats the newborn rabbits won’t receive          adequate quantity of milk and results in death of the young ones. In an          addition the other conditions such as death of dam, lack of maternal          care, falling of young ones from the cage results in difficulty in the          identification of the dams, the step mother is used for nursing the          young ones.
Points to be        considered while changing the litter to the step mother
The age difference               between the litters to be changed and the litter of step mother               should not be more than 48 hours
We should not change               more than 3 young ones/stepmother
Weaning of bunnies        or young rabbits
Young          rabbits allowed staying for first three weeks of age in the nest box.          Later nest box removed from the kindling cage. Weaning of young rabbits          or bunnies can be done at the age of 4-6 weeks. While weaning, first          dam should be removed from the kindling cage and the bunnies allowed          staying for 1-2 weeks in the same cage. Later the sex of the rabbits          should be identified and the different sexes are raised in different          cages. We should not suddenly change the diet or feed of the weaned          rabbits.
Reduction of        mortality rate in the bunnies
Up          to first 15 days of age the young rabbits are under the dam. During          this period the breast milk of the doe or dam is the only food for the          young ones. Death of the young rabbits in this period is mainly due to          doe or dam. After 15 days of age the young rabbits able to take water          and feed supplied to them. In this time they are more susceptible to          diseases. Therefore it is advisable to provide cooled boiled drinking          water to the dam and the young ones. Hydrogen peroxide at the rate of          1ml per liter of water is added 20 minutes before providing to the          rabbits.
Signs of healthy    rabbit

Diseases of rabbits
Pasteurellosis
Poor          ventilation, poor hygiene, nutritional deficiency are the risk factors          responsible for occurrence of this disease in rabbits. This disease          spreads from dam to young rabbits.
Clinical signs:
Treatment :
Enteritis
There          are various microorganisms responsible for producing enteritis in          rabbits. Sudden change in the feed, excess amount of carbohydrate in          the feed, immunodepression, unhygienic feed and water are the factors          predispose the rabbits for enteritis caused by various microorganisms.          The clinical signs of enteritis in rabbits are diarrhea, enlargement of          abdomen, dull hair coat and dehydration. Due to the loss of water due          to diarrhoea which leads to dehydration, rabbits become dull.
Wry neck disease
Rabbits          affected with the pasteurellosis are affected with wry neck disease.          This disease affects the middle ear and the brain of rabbits. Because          of the affection of membrane of the middle ear and pus is discharged          from the ear, the rabbit turn its head to one side. Effective treatment          of pasteurellosis controls the wry neck disease in rabbits.
Mastitis
Nursing          dams are affected with mastitis. Affected udder is hot, reddish and          painful to touch. Giving appropriate antibiotics to rabbits will          control the disease.
Diseases due to        fungal infection
Skin          infection is produced in rabbits by
Dermatopysis
Farm hygienic        measures to be followed to control disease in rabbitry
Rabbit farm should be               located in elevated place with good ventilation
The cages should be kept               very clean
There should be trees               around the rabbit shed
White washing should               done twice a year
Lime solution should be               applied below the cages twice a week
In summer seasons water               may be sprinkled on the rabbits to avoid death due to heat stroke
Before providing               drinking water it should be boiled and then cooled especially to               the dam and young ones
To prevent diseases               caused by bacterial microorganisms, Tetracycline mixed with               drinking water at the rate of 0.5 g/litter and given for a period               of 3 days per month

Emu rearing
Features of Emu
Emu has long neck, relatively      small naked head, three toes and body covered with feathers Birds initially      have longitudinal stripes on body (0-3 months age) then gradually turn to      brown by 4-12 months age. Mature birds have bare blue neck and mottled body      feathers. Adult bird height is about 6 feet with a weight of 45-60 kg. Legs      are long covered with scaly skin adaptable to hardy and dry soil. Natural      food of emu is insects, tender leaves of plant and forages. It also eats      different kinds of vegetables and fruits like carrot, cucumber, papaya etc.      Female is the larger of the two, especially during breeding season when the      male may fast. The female is the dominant member of the pair. Emus live for      about 30 years. It may produce eggs for more than 16 years. Birds can be      maintained as flock or pair.

Management of Chicks
Emu chicks weigh about 370 to      450 g (about 67% of egg weight) depending on the size of egg. First 48-72      hours, emu chicks are restricted to incubator for quick absorption of the      yolk and proper drying. Clean and disinfect brooding shed thoroughly and      well in advance of receiving chicks, spread litter (paddy husk) and cover      new gunny bags or burlap over the litter. Arrange a set of brooder for      about 25-40 chicks giving 4 sft per chick for first 3 weeks. Provide      brooding temperature of 900F at first 10 days and 850F till 3-4 weeks.      Proper temperature makes the brood successful. Provide sufficient water      mugs of a liter capacity and equal number of feeder troughs under the      brooder. A chick guard must be 2.5 feet height to avoid jumping and      straying of chicks. A 40 watt bulb should burn in the brooder shed      throughout the day for every 100 sft area. After 3 weeks of age, slowly      extend the brooder area by widening the chick guard circle and later remove      it by the time chicks attain 6 weeks. Feed starter mash for the first 14      weeks or till attaining standard body weight of 10 kg. Ensure proper floor      space for the birds housed, as these birds require run space for their      healthy life. 30 ft run space is required; hence floor space of 40ft x 30ft      is required for about 40 chicks, if out door space is provided. Floor must      be easily drained and free from dampness.
Do’s:
Never over crowd the pen
For the first few days,           provide sanitized water and anti-stress agents
Clean the waters daily,           otherwise automatic waters are preferable
Monitor the birds daily for           their comfort, feed intake, water intake, litter condition etc for           making immediate corrections if any.
Ensure proper mineral and           vitamins in the feed for healthy growth of chicks and to avoid leg           deformities.
Practice all- in -all -out           rearing to maintain better biosecurity
Don’ts:
Never handle the birds           during hot hours.
Birds easily excite. Hence,           calm and quite environment in the pen is required
Birds easily grab any item,           so avoid certain objects like nails, pebbles etc in the vicinity of           birds
Avoid unauthorized persons,           material into the farm. Proper biosecurity must be ensured
Never keep the birds on           smooth and paddy husk spread surface, as the young chicks easily           excite, run and break their legs due to slipperiness.
Grower management
As Emu chicks grow, they require      bigger size waterers and feeders and increased floor space. Identify sexes      and rear them separately. If necessary, place sufficient paddy husk in the      pen to manage the litter in good and dry condition. Feed the birds on      grower mash till birds attain 34 weeks age or 25 kg body weight. Offer      greens to about 10% of diet particularly different kinds of leaf meals for      making the birds adapt to fibrous diets. Provide clean water all the time      and offer feed as much as they want. Ensure dry litter condition through      out the grower stage. If necessary, add required quantity of paddy husk to      the pen. Provide 40ft x 100 ft space for 40 birds if out door space is      considered. Floor must be easily drained and avoid dampness. Restrain the      younger birds by securing the body by side ways and hold the body firmly.      Sub adults and adults can be secured by holding the wing by side way and by      grabbing both the wings and place by dragging closely to a persons legs.      Never allow bird to kick. Bird can kick side ways and front ways. Hence,      better securing and firm holding is necessary to avoid harming the bird as      well as person.
Monitor flock at least once           daily for alertness of birds, feeding and watering troughs
Notice leg deformities and           droppings. Identify and isolate ailing birds
Practice all- in –all- out           system. Never keep in the vicinity of the adult birds
Don’ts
Never keep sharp objects,           pebbles in the vicinity of the birds. Birds are mischievous and grab           any thing that comes in their vicinity.
Never handle or disturb the           birds for restraining or vaccination during the hot weather           conditions.
Provide cool and clean           water throughout the day.
Breeder management
Emu birds attain sexual maturity      by 18- 24 months age. Keep sex ratio of male to female as 1:1. In case of      pen mating, pairing should be done based on the compatibility. During      mating, offer floor space of about 2500 sft (100 x 25) per pair. Trees and      shrubs may be provided for privacy and to induce mating. Offer breeder diet      well in advance i.e 3- 4 weeks prior to breeding programme, and fortify      with minerals and vitamins to ensure better fertility and hatchability in      birds. Normally, adult bird consumes 1 kg feed /day. But during breeding      season, feed intake will be drastically reduced. Hence intake of nutrients      must be ensured.
Emu eggs
Incubation and    Hatching
Set the fertile eggs after      adjusting to room temperature. Place in a horizontal or in slant arranged      row-wise in a tray. Keep the egg incubator ready by cleaning and      disinfecting them thoroughly. Switch on the machine for setting the correct      incubating temperature i.e dry bulb temperature of about 96-970F and wet      bulb temperature of about 78-800F (about 30-40% RH). Place carefully the      egg tray in a setter, once the incubator is ready with set temperature and      relative humidity and place identification slip for date of set and      pedigree, if required. Fumigate the incubator with 20g potassium      permanganate + 40 ml formaline for every 100 cft of incubator space. Turn      the eggs every one hour till the 48th day of incubation. From 49th day      onwards, stop turning the eggs and watch for pipping. By 52nd day, the      incubation period ends. The chicks need drying. Hold the chicks for at      least 24 to 72 hours in the hatcher compartment, for reducing the down and      to become healthy chicks. Normally hatchability will be 70% or more. There      are many reasons for low hatchability. Proper breeder nutrition ensures      healthy chicks.
Feeding
Emus need balanced diet for      their proper growth and reproduction. Based on the literature, certain      nutrient requirements were suggested (Table 1 and 3). Feed can be prepared      by using common poultry feed ingredients (Table 2). Feed alone accounts for      60-70% of the production cost, hence least cost rations will improve the      margin of returns over feeding. In commercial farms, feed intake per emu      breeding pair per annum varied from 394-632 kg with a mean of 527kg. Cost      of feed was Rs.6.50 and 7.50 during non-breeding and breeding season      respectively.

Healthcare and    management
Ratite birds are generally      sturdy and live long (80% livability). Mortality and health problems in      emus are mainly in chicks and juveniles. These include starvation,      malnutrition, intestinal obstruction, leg abnormalities, coli infections      and clostridial infections. The main causes were improper brooding or      nutrition, stress, improper handling and genetic disorders. Other diseases      reported were rhinitis, candidiasis, salmonella, aspergillosis,      coccidiosis, lice and ascarid infestations. Ivermectin can be given to      prevent external and internal worms at 1 month interval beginning at 1      month age.
Emu products
Meat from emu and ostrich are of      high quality in terms of low fat, low cholesterol, gamey flavour. Valued      cuts are from thigh and larger muscle of drum or lower leg. Emu skin is      fine and strong. Leg skin is of distinctive pattern hence highly valued.      Emu fat is rendered to produce oil, which has dietary, therapeutic (anti-inflammatory)      and cosmetic value.
Economics
Emu farm economic survey      indicated that cost involved in purchase of breeding stock were expensive      (68%). The rest of the investments are on farm (13%) and hatchery (19%).      Feeding cost per breeding pair per annum was estimated to be Rs. 3600. Cost      of production of hatching egg and day-old chick was Rs.793 and 1232      respectively. Annual feed intake per pair was recorded as 524 kg, costing      Rs.3578. The cost of salable chick at day-old age was Rs.2500-3000. Better      returns from emu are possible with good hatchability (more than 80%), lower      feeding cost and minimized chick mortality (less than 10%).

Buck             weighs about 110-135 kgs and does weighs about 90-100 kgs
Kids             weighs about 20-30 kgs at 90 days of age
Selection of goats for breeding
Does
should           have kidding size of 2- 3 kids
should           mature at 6- 9 months
Bucks
Tall           with broad chest and slender body
matures           at age of 9- 12 months
Select           kids with good body weight at 6 months of age
select           from dam of 2- 3 kidding size

Feeding management
Grazing           along with concentrate feeding gives maximum growth rate
Feeding           protein rich green fodder such as acacia, leucerne and cassava and are           important sources of dietary nitrogen.
Farmers           can cultivate agathi, subabul and glaricidia trees along the border of           the farm and used as green fodder
Fodders           and trees cultivated in one acre of land is enough to feed 15-30 goats
Concentrate           feed can be prepared as follows.

Kids           should be provided with 50- 100 gms of concentrate for first 10 weeks.
For           growing ones concentrates should be provided 100 -150 gm daily for           3-10 months.
For           pregnant goat concentrates maybe given upto 200 gm daily.
Milch           goats producing 1 kg milk are provided 300 gms of concentrate daily
Mineral           blocks with rich copper (950-1250 ppm) should be provided in the goat           stalls.
Breeding Management
For      a profitable goat farming there should be 3 kidding for 2 years
Goats           with faster growth rate and larger size should be used for breeding.
Does of           one year of age should be used for breeding
Does           should bred after 3 months of kidding then only there will be 3           kidding for 2 years.
Goats           come into heat or estrus approximately every 18 to 21 days and the           heat will last for 24-72 hours.
Does in           heat become vocal and some bleat very loudly as if in pain. Constant           tail wagging from side to side is another sign of heat. In addition,           the vulva will appear slightly swollen and reddened and the area           around the tail may look wet and dirty because of vaginal discharge.           There is decreased appetite and an increased frequency of urination.           Doe in heat may mount another doe as if she were a buck or let another           doe mount her.
Does           can be bred 12-18 hours after the starting the estrus symptoms
In some           does the estrous period will last for 2-3 days. So they should bred           again in the next day.
Gestation           period is approximately 145-150 days, but up to one week either way is           fairly common. Better to be prepared well in advance.
Deworming
Before           breeding the doe should be dewormed. Those goats affected with worm           infestation are lean and dull
Kids           should be dewormed at one month of age. The life cycle of worms is           three weeks, so de-worming again at two months of age is recommended
Pregnant           does should be dewormed 2-3 weeks before kidding.
Does in           early pregnancy (upto 2 months) should not be dewormed to avoid           abortion.
Vaccinations
Kids           should be given first dose of Enterotoxaemia and Tetanus vaccination           at 8 weeks of age and again at 12 weeks of age..
Does           should be given Enterotoxaemia and Tetanus vaccination 4-6 weeks           before breeding season and 4-6 weeks before kidding.
Bucks           should be vaccinated with Enterotoxaemia and Tetanus once in a year
Housing for goats
1.      Deep litter system
A small           shed with good cross ventilation is enough to keep a small herd.
Litter           height should be atleat 6cms.
Litter           material maybe of sawdust, paddy husk and groundnut shell.
The litter           material has to be turned periodically to remove the foul odour in the           pen.
Litter           material should be replaced once in every 2 weeks.
Each           goat requires about 15 sq.ft area.
care           should be taken to reduce the external parasitic infestation.
An           adult goat produces about a tonne of manure in a year.
wooden           plank or wire mesh is placed about 3-4 ft from the ground level
External           parasitic infestation is usually less in this method
Raising methods
1.      Semi intensive system
Places           where less grazing lands, goats can be fed intensively with green           fodders and concentrates after grazing
2.      Intensive system
Goats           are fed with green fodder and concentrates in the shed.
No           grazing
house           maybe of deep litter system or raised platform system
Goat Insurance
Goats           can be insured from 4 months of age through General Insurance           companies
Insurance           can be claimed if death due to accident or diseases.

Feeding &    Nutrition
Complete feed:
Complete feed    consists of roughages and concentrate mixtures and it may be in mash, pellet    or in block  For   preparing   complete feed, forage,    concentrate ingredients and additives/ supplements are blended together as to    get the required quantity of protein/ energy/ minerals/ vitamins. The    complete feed system would help in utilizing the locally available crop    residues, agro-industrial by products and wastes that are fit  for    animal   feeding. Usually roughage and concentrate ratio is being maintained    as 60:40.  Complete feed provides the best avenue to incorporate the    urea in the ration of livestock. For high yielding cows 50:50 roughage:    concentrate is usually adequate.
Chaffed mix: finely    chopped roughages are mixed with ground concentrate ingredients.
Silage mix: fine    chopped silage is evenly mixed with concentrate mixture at the time of    feeding.
Mash mix:     roughages are ground, evenly mixed with concentrate ingredients and converted    to pellets using pellet mill.
Blocks: mixture of    roughages (chopped) and concentrate ingredients are pressed in a block of    desired shape and weight

Utility
Avoiding the    selective feeding
Optimum conditions    for rumen fermentation.
Simultaneous    availability of nitrogen and energy.
Easy handling and    transportation of feeds
Formulation of Concentrate:
Concentrate for dairy animals is a balanced combination of    protein, energy and minerals along with the desired vitamins. Adequate supply    of energy is especially important during early as well as peak pact of    lactation and last two months of pregnancy. Quantity of protein as well as    source protein is another factor to keep in mind while preparing a    concentrate ration. Minerals and vitaminsare equally important in the ration    of dairy animals.

By pass Nutrient technology
I. By pass Fat:
II. By pass    Protein:
Benefits:
Improves production performance of dairy animals.
Improves feed conversion efficiency of nutrients for growth    and milk production.
Better economic returns.
Total Mixed Rations
TMR feeding involves    reducing the particle size of various feed ingredients including the roughage    and concentrate portions and mixing them in  proper quantities and    proportions. The combined feed is further enriched with necessary mineral and    vitamin supplements and feed additives so that the final mixture is    a  complete balanced ration for the specific category of the dairy    stock. The ingredients chosen are those which are locally available and    within the easy reach of the dairy farmer and at his command or produced    within his farm holding.
There is enhanced dry matter intake because of improvement in    palatability.
The feeding of TMR reduces wastage and economizes feeding cost    and also labour saving.
It enables formulation of rations specific to the nutrient    needs of individual categories of dairy stock.
Complete Feed Blocks:
This technology ensures the availability of    all nutrients uniformly in balanced and adequate amount. It also avoids    wastage of feedsduring handling at the time of feeding, transportation    and storage, besides saving the labour and transportation expenditure. It    also facilitates  manipulation of diets, particularly those based on    agro-industrial byproductsfor making effective and economic formulations.
It is more useful during the scarcity situation (flood,    drought etc.) when feeds have to be transported for long distances.
It is also advantages for dairy farms located at big towns,    where space and labour are two major constraints
Mineral mixtures for dairy animals
Supplementation of    major minerals like Ca, P, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn, I, and Co etc.  is inevitable    to achieve optimum health and  production. Formulation of perfect    mineral mixture needs special considerations, since the requirements of    animals vary within different regions,species,   age of animals,     stage and level of  production and the purpose for which the animals are    reared.  There are two types of formulations of mineral mixture, one is    with salt and the other iswithout salt  It should  be mixed in the    concentrate mixture @ 2kg per 100 kg (without salt)   and @ 3 kg per 100    kg (with salt). Otherwise it can be supplemented @ 50 g per day per adult    anima  mixed in feed or in water.
Supplementation    increases the feed intake, feed conversion efficiency and productive    performance of animals in terms of growth, reproduction and milk production.
