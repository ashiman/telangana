Frequently Asked Questions
How do I install XAMPP?
XAMPP for Windows exists in three different flavors:
Installer:
ZIP:
7zip:
Note: If you extract the files, there can be false-positives virus warnings.
Using the installer:
The XAMPP control panel for start/stop Apache, MySQL, FileZilla & Mercury or install these server as services.
Installing from ZIP
Unzip the zip archives into the folder of your choice. XAMPP is extracting to the subdirectory "C:\xampp" below the selected target directory. Now start the file "setup_xampp.bat", to adjust the XAMPP configuration to your system.
If you choose a root directory "C:\" as target, you must not start "setup_xampp.bat".
Like with the installer version, you can now use the "XAMPP Control Panel" for additional tasks.
Does XAMPP include MySQL or MariaDB?
Since XAMPP 5.5.30 and 5.6.14, XAMPP ships MariaDB instead of MySQL. The commands and tools are the same for both.
How can I start XAMPP without setup?
If you extract XAMPP in a top level folder like "C:\" or "D:\", you can start most servers like Apache or MySQL directly without execution of the file "setup_xampp.bat".
Not using the setup script, or selecting relative paths in the setup script, is preferred if you are installing XAMPP on a usb drive. Because on each pc such a drive can have an other drive letter. You can switch from absolute to relative paths at any time with the setup script.
Using the installer from our Downloads page is the easiest way to install XAMPP. After the installation is complete, you will find XAMPP under   Start | Programs | XAMPP. You can use the XAMPP Control Panel to start/stop all server and also install/uninstall services.
How do I start and stop XAMPP?
The universal control center is the "XAMPP Control Panel" (thanks  www.nat32.com). It is started with:
\xampp\xampp-control.exe
You can also use some batchfiles to start/stop the servers:
Apache & MySQL start:
\xampp\xampp_start.exe
Apache & MySQL stop:
\xampp\xampp_stop.exe
Apache start:
\xampp\apache_start.bat
Apache stop:
\xampp\apache_stop.bat
MySQL start:
\xampp\mysql_start.bat
MySQL stop:
\xampp\mysql_stop.bat
Mercury Mailserver start:
\xampp\mercury_start.bat
Mercury Mailserver stop:
\xampp\mercury_stop.bat
FileZilla Server start:
\xampp\filezilla_start.bat
FileZilla Server stop:
\xampp\filezilla_stop.bat
How can I test that everything worked?
Type in the following URL at your favourite web browser:
http://localhost/
http://127.0.0.1/
Now you should see the XAMPP start page.
How can I install a server as a service?
Each server in XAMPP you can install also as Windows service. You can also install it from the XAMPP Control Panel. In this case it is necessary to run the scripts or the Control Panel with Administrator privileges.
Apache service install: \xampp\apache\apache_installservice.bat
Apache service uninstall: \xampp\apache\apache_uninstallservice.bat
MySQL service install: \xampp\mysql\mysql_installservice.bat
MySQL service uninstall: \xampp\mysql\mysql_uninstallservice.bat
FileZilla service (un)install: \xampp\filezilla_setup.bat
Mercury: No service installation available
Is XAMPP production ready?
XAMPP is not meant for production use but only for development environments. The way XAMPP is configured is to be open as possible to allow the developer anything he/she wants. For development environments this is great but in a production environment it could be fatal.
Here a list of missing security in XAMPP:
The MySQL administrator (root) has no password.
The MySQL daemon is accessible via network.
ProFTPD uses the password "lampp" for user "daemon".
PhpMyAdmin is accessible via network.
The XAMPP demopage is accessible via network.
The default users of Mercury and FileZilla are known.
All points can be a huge security risk. Especially if XAMPP is accessible via network and people outside your LAN. It can also help to use a firewall or a (NAT) router. In case of a router or firewall, your PC is normally not accessible via network. It is up to you to fix these problems. As a small help there is the "XAMPP Security console".
Please secure XAMPP before publishing anything online. A firewall or an external router are only sufficient for low levels of security. For slightly more security, you can run the "XAMPP Security console" and assign passwords.
If you want have your XAMPP accessible from the internet, you should go to the following URI which can fix some problems:
http://localhost/security/
With the security console you can set a password for the MySQL user "root" and phpMyAdmin. You can also enable a authentication for the XAMPP demopages.
This web based tool does not fix any additional security issues! Especially the FileZilla FTP server and the Mercury mail server you must secure yourself.
How do I uninstall XAMPP?
If you installed XAMPP using the installer version, please use the Uninstaller. The Uninstaller will delete all XAMPP entries from your registry and it will uninstall some installed services included with XAMPP. We highly recommend that you use the Uninstall program for removing XAMPP installations from the Installer version.Please backup all the data you want to keep before uninstalling XAMPP.
If you installed XAMPP using the ZIP and 7zip versions, shut down all XAMPP servers and exit all panels. If you installed any services, uninstall and shut them down too. Now simply delete the entire folder where XAMPP is installed. There are no registry entries and no environment variables to  clean up.
What is the "lite" version of XAMPP?
XAMPP Lite (means "light" as in "light-weight") is a smaller bundle of XAMPP components, which is recommended for quick work using only PHP and MySQL. Some servers or tools such as Mercury Mail and FileZilla FTP are missing in the Lite version.
Where should I place my web content?
The main directory for all WWW documents is \xampp\htdocs. If you put a file "test.html" in this directory, you can access it with the URI "http://localhost/test.html".
And "test.php"? Just use "http://localhost/test.php". A simple testscript can be:
A new subdirectory for your web? Just make a new directory (e.g. "new") inside the directory "\xampp\htdocs" (best without whitespaces and only ASCII), create a test file in this directory and access it with "http://localhost/new/test.php".

Can I move the XAMPP installation?
Yes. After moving of the XAMPP directory, you must execute "setup_xampp.bat". The paths in the configuration files will be adjusted with this step.
If you have installed any server as Windows service, you must first remove the Windows service, and after the moving you can install the service again.
Warning: The configuration files from your own scripts, like PHP applications, are not adjusted. But it's possible to write a "plug-in" for the installer. With such a plug-in, the installer can adjust such files too.
What are "Automatic start pages" for the WWW directories?
The standard filename for the Apache function "DirectoryIndex" is "index.html" or "index.php". Every time you are just browsing to a folder (e.g. "http://localhost/xampp/"), and Apache can find such a file, Apache is displaying this file instead of a directory listing.
Where can I change the configuration?
Almost all settings in XAMPP you can change with configuration files. Just open the file in a textedit and change the setting you want. Only FileZilla and Mercury should be configured with the application config tool.
Why can't XAMPP work on Windows XP SP2?
Microsoft delivers a better firewall with service pack 2 (SP2), which starts automatically. This firewall now blocks the necessary ports 80 (http) and 443 (https) and Apache can't start.
The fast solution:
Disable the Microsoft firewall with the toolbar and try to start XAMPP onces more. The better solution is to define an exception within the security center.
The following ports are used for basic functionality:
Apache (HTTP): Port 80
Why doesn't XAMPP work on Vista?
User Account Control (UAC)
In the directory "C:\program files" you don't have full write privileges, even as Admin. Or you have only limited privileges (e.g. for ".\xampp\htdocs"). In this case you can't edit a file.
Solution:
You have installed Apache/MySQL in "C:\xampp" as Windows service. But you can't start/stop the services with the "XAMPP Control Panel" or can't uninstall them.
Disabling the User Account Control (UAC)
To disable the UAC, use the program "msconfig". In "msconfig" go to "Tools", select "disable user account control" and verify your selection. Now you must restart Windows. At the same time, you can enable the UAC again.
How do I check the md5 checksum?
To compare files, often checksums are used. A standard to create this checksum md5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5).
With this md5 checksum you can test, if your download of the XAMPP package is correct or not. Of course you need a program which can create these checksums. For Windows you can use a tool from Microsoft:
Availability and description of the File Checksum Integrity Verifier utility
It's also possible to use any other program which can create md5 checksums, like the GNU md5sum.
As you have installed such a program (e.g. fciv.exe), you can do following steps:
Download XAMPP (f.e. xampp-win32-1.8.2-0.exe)
Create the checksum with:
fciv.exe xampp-win32-1.8.2-0.exe
And now you can compare this checksum with that one you can find on the XAMPP for Windows homepage.
If both checksums equal, all is ok. If not, the download is broken or the file has been changed.
Why have changes in my php.ini not taken effect?
If a change in the "php.ini" has no effect, it's possible PHP is using a different one. You can verify this with phpinfo(). Go to the URI  http://localhost/xampp/phpinfo.php and search for "Loaded Configuration File". This value shows you the "php.ini" PHP is really using.
Note:
Help! There is a virus in XAMPP!
Some antivirus programs mistake XAMPP for a virus, typically flagging the file xampp-manager.exe This is a false positive meaning that the antivirus erroneously identified it as a virus, when it is not. Before we release each new version of XAMPP we run it through virus scanning software. At the moment we are using
Kapersky Online Virus Scanner
Virus Total
How do I configure my antivirus application?
We have included all dependences and servers required for running the bundled web application, so you will find that XAMPP installs large numbers of files. If you are installing a XAMPP application on a Windows machine with an antivirus app enabled, this may slow down the installation significantly, and there is also a chance that one of the servers (web server, database server) may be blocked by the antivirus software. If you have an antivirus tool enabled, check the following settings for running XAMPP without performance issues:
Add exceptions in the firewall: for Apache, MySQL or any other server.
Scan files when executing: If you have enabled the antivirus scan for all files, the executable files for the servers may slow down.
Scan the traffic for different URLs: If you are developing with XAMPP on your own machine, you can exclude "localhost" traffic in the Antivirus settings.
Why doesn't the Apache server start on my system?
This problem can be one of several reasons:
You have started more then one HTTP Server (IIS, Sambar, ZEUS and so on). Only one Server can use port 80. This error message indicate the problem:
(OS 10048)... make_sock: could not bind to adress 0.0.0.0:80
no listening sockets available, shutting down
You have other software, such as the Internet Telephone "Skype" which also blocks the port 80. If the problem is "Skype", you can go in Skype to Actions --> Options --> Connection --> remove the check mark at "use port 80 for an alternate port" and restart Skype. Now it should work.
You have a firewall which blocks the Apache port. Not all firewalls are compatible with Apache, and sometimes deactivating the firewall is not enough and you must deinstall it. This error message indicates a firewall:
(OS 10038)Socket operation on non-socket: make_sock: for address 0.0.0.0:80,
apr_socket_opt_set: (SO_KEEPALIVE)
Also if Apache can start, but your browser can't connect to it it could be due to one of the following:
Some virus scanners can cause this in the same way that firewalls can interfere.
You have XP Professional without service pack 1. You must have at least SP1 for XAMPP.
Tip:
Why is my CPU load for Apache almost 99%?
There is one of two scenarios at play here. Either your CPU is maxing out, or you can browser connect to the server, but not see anything (the system is trying unsucessfully to load the page). In either case you can find the following message in the Apache log file:
Child: Encountered too many AcceptEx faults accepting client connections.
winnt_mpm: falling back to 'AcceptFilter none'.
The MPM falls back to a safer implementation, but some client requests were not processed correctly. In order to avoid this error, use "AcceptFilter" with accept filter "none" in the "\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-mpm.conf" file.
Why are pictures and style-sheets not displayed?
Sometimes there are problems with displaying pictures and style-sheets. Especially if these files are located on a network drive. In this case you can enable (or add) one if the following lines in the file "\xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf":
EnableSendfile off
EnableMMAP off
This problem can also be caused by programs for regulating bandwidth, like NetLimiter.
How can I set a root password in MySQL?
Configure it with the "XAMPP Shell" (command prompt). Open the shell from the XAMPP control pane and execute this command:
mysqladmin.exe -u root password secret
Can I use my own MySQL server?
Yes. Simply don't start the MySQL from the XAMPP package. Please note that two servers cannot be started on the same port. If you have set a password for "root", please do not forget to edit the file "\xampp\phpMyAdmin\config.inc.php".
How do I restrict access to phpMyAdmin from the outside?
In the basic configuration of XAMPP, phpMyAdmin is accessible only from the same host that XAMPP is running on, at http://127.0.0.1 or http://localhost.
Before you can access the MySQL server, phpMyAdmin will prompt you for a user name and password. Don't forget to set a password for the user "root" first.
How do I enable access to phpMyAdmin from the outside?
To enable remote access to phpMyAdmin, follow these steps:
Edit the apache\conf\extra\httpd-xampp.conf file in your XAMPP installation directory.
Within this file, find the line below and update it to remove 'phpmyadmin' from the list of locations.
Restart the Apache server using the XAMPP control panel.
Where is the IMAP support for PHP?
As default, the IMAP support for PHP is deactivated in XAMPP due to some mysterious initialization errors with some home versions like Windows 98. If you work with NT systems, you can open the file "\xampp\php\php.ini" to activate the php exstension by removing the beginning semicolon at the line ";extension=php_imap.dll". It should be:
extension=php_imap.dll
Now restart Apache and IMAP should work. You can use the same steps for every extension, which is not enabled in the default configuration.
Why don't some PHP open source apps work with XAMPP on Windows?
A lot of PHP applications or extensions that have been written for Linux haven’t been ported to Windows.
Can I delete the "install" directory after installation?
It's better not to. The scripts here are still needed for all additional packages (add-ons) and upgrades of XAMPP.
How do I activate the eaccelerator?
Like other (Zend) extensions, you can activate it in "php.ini". In this file, enable the line ";zend_extension = "\xampp\php\ext\php_eaccelerator.dll"". It should be:
zend_extension = "\xampp\php\ext\php_eaccelerator.dll"
How do I fix a connection error to my MS SQL server?
If the mssql extension was loaded in the php.ini, sometimes problems appear when only TCP/IP is used. You can fix that problem with a newer "ntwdblib.dll" from Microsoft. Please replace the older file in "\xampp\apache\bin" and "\xampp\php" with the new one. Because of the license, we can't package a newer version of this file with XAMPP.
How do I work with the PHP mcrypt extension?
For this, we have opened a topic in the forum with examples and possible solutions:
MCrypt topic
Do Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) work with XAMPP?
No. And Apache::ASP with the Perl Add-On is not the same. Apache::ASP only knows Perl-Script, but ASP from the Internet Information Server (IIS) also knows the normal VBScript. But for ASP .NET, there is a 3rd party Apache module available.
How can I get XAMPP working on port 80 under Windows 10?
By default, Windows 10 starts Microsoft IIS on port 80, which is the same default port used by Apache in XAMPP. As a result, Apache cannot bind to port 80.
To disable IIS from running on port 80, follow these steps:
Open the Services panel in Computer Management.
Search for the 'World Wide Web Publishing Service' and select it.
Click the link to 'Stop the service'.
Double-click the service name.
In the 'Startup type' field, change the startup type to 'Disabled'.
Click 'OK' to save your changes.
You should now be able to start Apache in XAMPP on port 80.
For more information, refer to the 'Troubleshoot Apache Startup Problems' guide included with XAMPP or
this forum post
How can I use Microsoft Edge to access local addresses under Windows 10?
If your local machine has the host name 'myhost', you will not be able to access URLs such as http://myhost in Microsoft Edge. To resolve this, you should instead use the addresses http://127.0.0.1 or http://localhost.

By default, XAMPP runs PHP as an Apache handler. An alternative approach is to run PHP under FastCGI, which can produce better performance in certain scenarios. To do this, follow these steps:
Download a binary version of the
mod_fcgid
the ApacheLounge website
modules-2.4.x-win32-VC11.zip
XAMPP for Windows only uses 32-bit Apache builds.
Extract the
mod_fcgid.so
apache\modules
C:\xampp
Edit the
httpd-xampp.conf
apache\conf\extra\
Search for the line
LoadModule php5_module "/xampp/php/php5apache2_4.dll"
and modify it to read
LoadModule fcgid_module modules/mod_fcgid.so
Find and delete the following lines:
Add the following lines:
FcgidInitialEnv PHPRC "c:/xampp/php"
AddHandler fcgid-script .php
FcgidWrapper "c:/xampp/php/php-cgi.exe" .php
Remember to adjust the file and directory paths above to reflect valid paths on your system.
Restart your Apache server through the XAMPP control panel for your changes to take effect.
PHP should now be active using FastCGI. To verify this, browse to the URL

In many cases, you might want to use XAMPP with a different PHP version than the one that comes pre-installed. You might do this to get the benefits of a newer version of PHP, or to reproduce bugs using an earlier version of PHP.
To use a different version of PHP with XAMPP, follow these steps:
Download a binary build of the PHP version that you wish to use from the PHP website, and extract the contents of the compressed archive file to your XAMPP installation directory (usually,
C:\xampp
C:\xampp\php5-6-0
Ensure that the PHP build you download matches the Apache build (VC9 or VC11) in your XAMPP platform.
Within the new directory, rename the
php.ini-development
php.ini
php.ini-production
Edit the

In particular, be sure to change the lines
LoadFile "/xampp/php/php5ts.dll"
LoadFile "/xampp/php/libpq.dll"
LoadModule php5_module "/xampp/php/php5apache2_4.dll"
to
LoadFile "/xampp/php5-6-0/php5ts.dll"

XAMPP cannot start on port 80 (Windows 10)
The Microsoft Edge browser cannot be used to access local addresses using the machine host name.
Are you having difficulty getting your Apache server started? Here is a list of common problems and their solutions.
The information in this document is based on
this ApacheFriends community forum thread
Your XAMPP control panel displays this message:
XX:XX:XX [Apache] Port 80 in use by "Unable to open process" with PID 4!
To solve this problem, follow these steps:
Right-click the XAMPP control panel icon and select "Run as administrator". Enter administrator credentials (if required) and click "OK" or "Yes" to proceed.
Open your Windows command prompt by clicking the "Shell" button in the XAMPP control panel.
At the command prompt, enter this command:
netsh http add iplisten ipaddress=::
Open the file
C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
127.0.0.1  localhost
This takes care of mapping the
localhost
On some versions of Windows, you will not be able to edit the
If the problem persists even after performing these steps, it could be due to a problem with Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), with Windows Work Folders or with third-party services.
Refer to this page for alternative solutions
Your XAMPP control panel displays these messages:
XX:XX:XX [Apache] Port 80 in use by "C:\Program Files (x86)\Skype\Phone\Skype.exe" with PID XXXX!
XX:XX:XX [Apache] Port 443 in use by "C:\Program Files (x86)\Skype\Phone\Skype.exe" with PID XXXX!
Launch Skype.
Select the "Tools → Options → Advanced → Connection" menu item and in the resulting screen, disable the use of ports 80 and 443 for incoming Skype connections.
Click "Save". Restart Skype for your change to take effect.
XX:XX:XX [Apache] Port 443 in use by ""C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation\vmware-hostd.exe" -u "C:\ProgramData\VMware\hostd\config.xml"" with PID XXXX!
Launch VMWare Workstation.
Use the "Edit → Preferences → Shared VMs" menu and in the resulting dialog, enter a new port number for the VMWare Workstation Server.
Click "OK" to save your changes. Restart VMWare Workstation for your change to take effect.
Apache startup includes an error message like the one below:
httpd.exe: Syntax error on line XX of X:/xampp/apache/conf/httpd.conf: ServerRoot must be a valid directory
This is a common issue for XAMPP installations on portable devices. It occurs if the Apache configuration file points to a directory that no longer exists (for example, due to a drive letter change when a portable device is removed and reinserted). To solve this problem, follow these steps:
If the Apache service is registered (indicated by a green check mark next to its name in the XAMPP control panel), unregister it by clicking the check mark and answering "Yes" in the resulting dialog box.
Edit the
setup_xampp.bat
C:\xampp
%PHP_BIN% -n -d output_buffering=0 %CONFIG_PHP%
Edit the line to include the special directive "usb" at the end, so that it looks like this.
%PHP_BIN% -n -d output_buffering=0 %CONFIG_PHP% usb
Save your changes. The, execute the file by double-clicking it in the Windows Explorer or executing it at the command prompt. This will fix any and all wrong base paths.
By default, Windows 10 starts Microsoft IIS on port 80, which is the same default port used by Apache in XAMPP. As a result, Apache cannot bind to port 80.
To check whether port 80 is in use, open a command prompt and run these commands:
netstat -o -n -a | findstr 0.0.0.0:80
netstat -o -n -a | findstr 127.0.0.1:80
To disable IIS from running on port 80, follow these steps:
Open the Services panel in Computer Management.
Search for the "World Wide Web Publishing Service" and select it.
Click the link to "Stop the service".
Double-click the service name.
In the "Startup type" field, change the startup type to "Disabled".
Click "OK" to save your changes.
You should now be able to start Apache in XAMPP on port 80.
If your local machine has the host name 'myhost', you will not be able to access URLs such as
http://myhost
http://127.0.0.1
http://localhost

By default, the MySQL/MariaDB installation that ships with XAMPP has an empty root password. This is a serious security risk, especially if you plan to use XAMPP in production scenarios.
To change the MySQL/MariaDB root password, follow these steps:
Ensure that the MySQL/MariaDB server is running.
Open your Windows command prompt by clicking the "Shell" button in the XAMPP control panel.
Use the
mysqladmin
mysqladmin --user=root password "newpassword"
For example, to change the MySQL/MariaDB root password from its default empty value to the password
gue55me
mysqladmin --user=root password "gue55me"
Or, if a password has already been previously set and you’d like to change it to a new one, you can use the following syntax:
mysqladmin --user=root --password=oldpassword password "newpassword"
For example, to change the root password from
12345
mysqladmin --user=root --password=12345 password "gue55me"
Test that your password change has been accepted, by attempting to connect to the MySQL/MariaDB server using the
mysql
mysql --user=root --password=gue55me -e "SELECT 1+1"

Git
This guide walks you through the process, showing you how to use a git client to transfer code from a public online git repository to your XAMPP server. As an example, this guide assumes that you wish to download the latest version of
Slim
Git Extensions
download it from the official Git Extensions website
install it using these instructions
To download Slim (or any other application) from its git repository, follow these steps:
Ensure that your Apache server is running.
Obtain the repository’s clone URL. On Github, this can be easily obtained by visiting the project’s Github page and copying the clone URL from the right side of the page. For third-party or private git repositories, you can obtain the clone URL by asking the project team directly. Make a note of the clone URL, as you’ll need it in subsequent steps.
Launch Git Extensions by double-clicking the icon in the Windows Start menu or Start screen.
Click the "Clone repository" link or use the "Start → Clone repository…​" menu item.
In the resulting "Clone" dialog box, enter the clone URL obtained in the first step. Set the destination directory to the
htdocs\
C:\xampp
Click the "Clone" button to start cloning the repository. Git Extensions will display a progress dialog as it downloads the code from the source repository.
Once the repository has been cloned, Git Extensions will prompt you to open the new repository. Click "Yes".
You should now see the entire commit history of the repository in a graphical tree structure, together with details on the changes made in each commit.
At this point, the code has been downloaded from the remote git repository and you can begin using it. In this particular case, since the Slim framework includes a starter application, you can simply browse to the URL
http://localhost/Slim
You can use Git Extensions to create a new branch of the codebase should you wish to make any changes to it. Any changes you make will be automatically reflected in the Git Extensions interface, and if you have appropriate privileges, you can also commit your changes back to the remote repository.

configure-vhosts.pdf
Apache makes it easy to have multiple websites or web applications running on the same physical server, and access each using a custom domain name. This is known as
virtual hosting
This feature is especially useful in development scenarios, as it allows developers to isolate and access different applications using unique domain names. For example, the domains
http://app01.localhost
http://app02.localhost
http://client1/
http://client2/
Virtual hosts created in this manner will not be accessible from other systems, unless those systems are separately configured to associate the custom domain used by the virtual host with the IP address of the XAMPP server.
This guide walks you through the process of setting up a new virtual host with XAMPP, by creating and configuring an example host named
wordpress.localhost
C:\xampp\apps\wordpress\htdocs\
http://localhost/wordpress
You can install WordPress with just a few clicks using the
Bitnami WordPress Module for XAMPP
Follow the steps below to create a virtual host:
Change to your XAMPP installation directory (typically,
C:\xampp
httpd-vhosts.conf
apache\conf\extra\
Replace the contents of this file with the following directives:
This contains two virtual host configuration blocks:
The first block is the default or fallback virtual host, which is used for all requests that are not matched by subsequent blocks.
The second block sets up a virtual host named
To add more virtual hosts, simply duplicate the second virtual host block and modify the port number, DocumentRoot and ServerName directives as per your requirements. For example, if you want to use SSL with your custom domain name, you can add a new virtual host block for port 443.
If you plan to have a large number of virtual hosts with very similar configuration, consider using wildcard-based subdomains with your virtual hosts.
Restart Apache using the XAMPP control panel for your changes to take effect.
At this point, your virtual host is configured. However, if you try browsing to the

XAMPP includes the server version of
FileZilla
To illustrate, assume that you have a simple PHP script named
example.php
To transfer files using FTP, you must first configure the FileZilla FTP server. Follow the steps below.
Ensure that FileZilla is running.
Start the FileZilla administration interface by clicking the "Admin" button in the XAMPP control panel.
In the resulting "Connect to Server" dialog box, leave all values at their default values and click "OK".
You should now arrive at the FileZilla server console.
You now need to set up at least one FTP user. To do this, click the "Edit → Users" menu item. This will bring you to the user management interface.
Click the "Add" button to add a new user account. Enter a name for the new user account.
Select and check the "Password" field and enter a password for the new user.
Next, you need to define which folders the user has access to. To do this, click the "Shared folder" sub-item in the left navigation menu.
Click the "Add" button and select the
htdocs\
Grant the user all available rights to this directory.
Click "OK" to save your changes.
Use the "File → Quit" menu item to disconnect from the FileZilla administration interface.
You can now transfer files to the XAMPP server by following the steps below:
Launch your FTP client and enter connection details as below.
If you’re connecting to the server from the same system, use "127.0.0.1" as the host address. If you’re connecting from a different system, use the network hostname or IP address of the XAMPP server.
Use "21" as the port.
Specify the username and password configured previously as your FTP credentials.
Your FTP client should now connect to the server and enter the
C:\xampp\htdocs
Transfer the file from your home directory to the server using normal FTP transfer conventions. If you’re using a graphical FTP client, you can usually drag and drop the file from one directory to the other. If you’re using a command-line FTP client, you can use the FTP PUT command.
Once the file is successfully transferred, you should be able to see it in action by browsing to

Introduction
Step 1: Install Bitnami WordPress module for XAMPP
Step 2: Test WordPress
Step 3: Create an Editor Account and Start Blogging
Although you might not have realized this, XAMPP comes with a number of
add-on applications
Drupal
Joomla!
WordPress
XAMPP add-ons are provided by
Bitnami
In this article, I’ll walk you through the process of installing the Bitnami WordPress add-on for XAMPP, showing you how to quickly get started with one of the world’s most popular blogging platforms. Keep reading!
== Assumptions and Prerequisites
This tutorial doesn’t make a lot of assumptions, but the few that it does are important.
First, it assumes that you have a working XAMPP installation on Windows, and that your XAMPP installation (including MySQL/MariaDB) is currently running. In case you don’t have this,
download and install XAMPP
http://localhost
You can also check that both MySQL/MariaDB and Apache are running using the XAMPP control panel icon in the Windows taskbar:
Second, it assumes that you’ve already downloaded the Windows WordPress add-on for XAMPP. In case you don’t have this, you can
download it from the XAMPP Add-ons page
Did you check both the boxes above? You’re good to begin!
You can now begin installing WordPress on top of XAMPP by following these steps:
Launch the installer by double-clicking it. You might see a security warning about running the file, since it’s been downloaded from the Internet. Click "Run" to proceed.
Next, you should see a splash screen, followed by a prompt for installation language. The installer is available in nine languages, including English, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Korean, German and Russian. Select your language and you’ll be transferred to the main setup wizard.
The WordPress add-on requires a pre-existing XAMPP installation. Select your XAMPP installation directory (usually,
C:\xampp
Next, you’ll be prompted to set up the WordPress administrator account. Enter a user name, real name and email address for the WordPress administrator account.
You’ll also see three password fields. In the first field, enter the existing MySQL/MariaDB password for XAMPP; this  is needed by the setup wizard so that it can create the necessary WordPress tables in your MySQL/MariaDB database. In the remaining two fields, enter a password (minimum 6 characters) for the WordPress administrator account.
Next, enter a title for your WordPress blog. Don’t worry, you can change this later!
WordPress can optionally send you notifications on events, such as when someone comments on a post. The setup wizard lets you configure how these email notifications are sent out. You can either use a Gmail account or a custom mail server.
If you’re using a Gmail account, simply enter your complete Gmail address and account password. For security reasons, it is recommended that you set up a separate Gmail account for notifications, rather than using your regular Gmail address.
If you don’t have a Gmail account or if you’d prefer to use a custom mail server, enter details for the mail server, such as the account username and password, SMTP server name and port, and security configuration.
You’re almost done! Click Next a few times, decide whether you want to read more about Bitnami in a new browser window while the installation progresses, and the wizard will take care of the rest.
Once installation is complete, you’ll see a success screen. Click "Finish" to exit the installation and launch WordPress.
By default, WordPress is installed in your XAMPP installation directory, in the
apps/wordpress
http://127.0.0.1/wordpress
http://localhost/wordpress
To delete this sample post or to create a new post, you need to first log in to the WordPress dashboard. You can do this either by clicking the "Log in" link in the left navigation bar or by browsing to
http://localhost/wordpress/wp-login.php
Log in using the administrator account you created in the previous step.
You should now arrive at the WordPress dashboard, which allows you to manage posts, pages and comments; customize your blog with themes and plugins; import and export content; manage navigation menus; add or delete new user accounts; and much more.
As a general rule, you shouldn’t use the administrator account for routine tasks, such as creating posts or replying to comments. So, one of the first things you should do is create a new user account with minimal privileges, which you can use for these routine tasks. To do this:
Select the "Users → Add New" menu option to create a new user account.
Enter a username, real name, password and other details for the account.
Assign the new account the role of "Editor".
Click the "Add New User" button to create the new user account.
Once the account is created, use the "Log out" button (in the pop-up menu at the top left corner of the page) to log out. Then, log in using the new account you just created. You should return to the WordPress dashboard, but with a restricted set of tools.
You can now add a new post using the following steps:
Select the "Posts → Add New" menu option to create a new post.
Enter a title and content for the post. You can use the formatting tools at the top of the content area to format your post and add hyperlinks or images.
Optionally, choose the format and category for your post.
Publish it immediately using the "Publish" button.
And now, when you visit your blog’s front page, you should see your new post.
Congratulations! You now have a working, fully-functional WordPress blog.
You can keep your WordPress installation up-to-date with the WordPress automatic update feature. To access this:
Log in to WordPress using the administrator account.
Select the "Dashboard → Updates" menu item.
Review the resulting page to see if WordPress needs an update. If an update it available, you can install it by clicking the "Update Now" button. You can also re-install WordPress if needed with the "Re-install Now" button.

Using phpMyAdmin
Using Command-Line Tools
As you use XAMPP, you might find that you need to backup or restore a MySQL or MariaDB database. There are two easy ways to do this with XAMPP: using the browser-based phpMyAdmin tool or using MySQL/MariaDB’s command-line tools. This guide describes both options.
This guide assumes that you already have a PHP application that uses a MySQL/MariaDB database deployed on XAMPP. The example application used in this guide is WordPress, although the steps outlined below will work for any application.
Remember that you can install WordPress quickly using the
Bitnami WordPress module for XAMPP
XAMPP includes
Browse to
http://localhost/phpMyAdmin
http://127.0.0.1/phpMyAdmin
root
Select the database to be backed up from the list in the left navigation pane. In this case, we’re backing up the WordPress database, which is named
bitnami_wordpress
Select the "Export" command in the top navigation bar.
On the resulting page, select "Quick" as the export method and "SQL" as the output format. Click "Go" to proceed.
phpMyAdmin will export the database to a text file as a series of SQL statements. Once done, the browser will prompt you to download it to the desktop. This text file is your backup, so store it safely!
At a later point, you may wish to restore the database. To restore the data to a fresh MySQL/MariaDB database using phpMyAdmin, follow these steps:
Select the "New" command in the left navigation pane.
On the resulting page, enter a name for the new database (in this case,
myblog
Once the database has been created, it will appear in the left navigation pane.
Select the new database from the left navigation pane. In the resulting page, select the "Import" command in the top navigation bar.
Click the "Browse…​" button and select the backup file created earlier. Click "Go" to proceed.
phpMyAdmin will import the data from the backup file. Once complete, you will see a screen indicating the status of the import.
If you browse the contents of the database, you should now see your original data.
You should now update your application’s configuration and point it to your newly-created database. For example, with the Bitnami WordPress module, you will need to edit the
wp-config.php
apps\wordpress\htdocs\
DB_NAME
By default, PHP (and therefore phpMyAdmin) is configured to only accept uploads up to 2 MB in size. If your database is larger than this, you need to modify the PHP configuration file to accept a larger upload size. To do this, edit the
php.ini
php\
post_max_size
upload_max_filesize
MySQL and MariaDB include two command-line tools that you can use to quickly backup and restore databases. The
mysqldump
mysql
To backup a MySQL/MariaDB database from the command line, follow these steps:
Launch a new Windows command shell using the "Shell" button in the XAMPP control panel.
Use the command below to export the contents of the selected database. In this example, we’re backing up the WordPress database, which is named
bitnami_wordpress.sql
mysqldump --user=root --password="" bitnami_wordpress > bitnami_wordpress.sql
At a later point, you may wish to restore the database. To restore the data to a fresh MySQL/MariaDB database from the command line, follow these steps:
Use the
mysql --user=root --password="" -e "CREATE DATABASE myblog"
Remember to use the correct database access credentials in the command. On a fresh XAMPP installation without any changes, you can usually log in as root with a blank password.
mysql --user=root --password="" --database=myblog < bitnami_wordpress.sql
The command-line client will now import the data from the backup file.

configure-wildcard-subdomains.pdf
Apache’s virtual hosting feature makes it easy to host multiple websites or web applications on the same server, each accessible with a different domain name. However, when you have a large number of virtual hosts sharing almost-identical configuration, wildcard-based subdomains simplify maintenance and reduce the effort involved in adding a new virtual host.
With wildcard subdomains, it’s no longer necessary to edit the Apache configuration file or restart the server to initialize a new virtual host. Instead, you simply need to create a subdirectory matching the subdomain name on the server with your content, and Apache will automatically use that directory to serve requests for the corresponding subdomain.
Virtual hosts created in this manner will not be accessible from other systems, unless those systems are separately configured to associate the custom domains used by virtual hosts with the IP address of the XAMPP server.
This guide walks you through the process of setting up wildcard virtual hosts with XAMPP, such that requests for
subdomain.localhost
subdomain/
C:\xampp
httpd.conf
apache\conf\
LoadModule vhost_alias_module modules/mod_vhost_alias.so
Next, edit the
httpd-vhosts.conf
apache\conf\extra\
Replace the contents of this file with the following directives:
UseCanonicalName Off
<VirtualHost *:80>
       DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/"
       ServerName localhost
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerAlias *.localhost
       VirtualDocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/%1/"
</VirtualHost>
In this configuration, the first virtual host block configures how requests are handled by default. The second block configures wildcard virtual hosting for subdomains, such that requests for
subdomain\
C:\xampp\htdocs\
Restart Apache using the XAMPP control panel for your changes to take effect.
At this point, your wildcard subdomains are configured. You can easily test this by using the Windows Explorer to create two new subdirectories at
C:\xampp\htdocs\app01\
C:\xampp\htdocs\app02\
index.html
Since these domains do not actually exist in reality, you also need to map them to the local IP address. Open the file
C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
127.0.0.1           app01.localhost   app02.localhost
You will need to do this every time you want to configure a new wildcard virtual host, because the Windows

The previous steps discussed how to create and use an SQLite database using the command-line client. However, more often than not, you’ll be using an SQLite database in combination with a PHP-powered Web application. XAMPP includes the PHP SQLite extension, so doing this is not very difficult at all.
To connect to your SQLite database and execute queries on it with PHP, use your text editor to create an example script named

Aasara Pension for Widows
Government of Telangana as a part of its social safety net strategy introduced the 'Aasara Pensions' with a view to ensure secure life with dignity for the poor. This scheme is meant to protect the most vulnerable sections of society in particular the old and infirm; people with HIV-AIDS, widows, incapacitated weavers and toddy tappers, who have lost their means of livelihood with growing age, in order to support their day to day minimum needs required to lead a life of dignity and social security.
It is observed that the districts of Siddipet, Jangaon and Warangal Rural have more than 50 widows for every 1000 population who are beneficiaries of this scheme making up for the highest density of widow pensioners of all the 31 districts.
