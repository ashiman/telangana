A screen reader is a software application that enables people with
				severe visual impairments to use a computer. Screen readers work
				closely with the computer Operating System (OS) to provide
				information about icons, menus, dialogue boxes, files and folders. A
				screen reader provides access to the entire OS that it works with,
				including many common applications.
A screen reader uses a Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine to
					translate on-screen information into speech, which can be heard
					through earphones or speakers. A TTS may be a software application
					that comes bundled with the screen reader, or it may be a hardware
					device that plugs into the computer. Originally, before computers
					had soundcards, screen readers always used hardware TTS devices,
					but now that soundcards come as standard on all computers many find
					that a software TTS is preferable. In addition to speech feedback,
					screen readers are also capable of providing information in
					Braille. An external hardware device, known as a refreshable
					Braille display is needed for this. A refreshable Braille display
					contains one or more rows of cells. Each cell can be formed into
					the shape of a Braille character, a series of dots that are similar
					to domino dots in their layout. As the information on the computer
					screen changes, so does the Braille characters on the display
					change, providing refreshable information directly from the
					computer. Whilst it is possible to use either format independently,
					Braille output is commonly used in conjunction with speech output.

STATE HISTORY
The new State of Telangana came into existence on 2
nd
th
Telangana has the advantage of having most of the east
						flowing rivers in the heart of the state bringing in copious
						supplies from the Western and Eastern Ghats and the Deccan Plateau
						up to Bay of Bengal. However most of the flows occur only in 3 to
						4 months of South West monsoon i.e., June to September. The annual
						rainfall is between 900 to 1500 mm in northern Telangana and 700
						to 900 mm.
Telangana is a riverine state with major, medium and minor
						rivers. Of these two are major interstate rivers i.e., 1.Godavari
						and 2.Krishna. Godavari and Krishna flow through the heart of the
						state. Total water allocated to Projects in Telangana in Krishna
						basin is 299 TMC and Godavari basin is 954.23 TMC. Apart from the
						2 major rivers, there are other 9 Nos. of small rivers such as
						Bhima, Dindi, Kinnerasani, Manjeera, Manair, Penganga, Pranahita,
						Peddavagu and Taliperu.
Telangana has a heritage of cultivation and irrigation
						dating back to several centuries. In the past, ancient Kings and
						rulers built lakes and reservoirs by constructing bunds and
						anicuts across rivers for creating irrigation potential as well as
						drinking water for the people. Big lakes like Ramappa, Pakhal,
						Laknavaram and many other irrigation works of Kakatiya period have
						become names to remember and are serving till today. The Mir Alam
						Tank is the finest example in arched dam constructed across Musi
						River. The GhanapurAnicut across Manjira with two canals called
						Fathenahar and Mahabobnahar, Pocharamlake, Osmansagar,
						Himayatsagar, Nizamsagar Project, Mannair Project, Dindi Project,
						Palair Project, Wyra Project and Sarlasagar Projects are some of
						the magnificent contributions of the eminent Engineers of
						Hyderabad State under Nawab Ali Nawaz Jung Bahadur and other
						eminent Engineers during the Nizam's kingdom in Telangana.

STATE HISTORY
The new State of Telangana came into existence on 2
nd
th
Telangana has the advantage of having most of the east
						flowing rivers in the heart of the state bringing in copious
						supplies from the Western and Eastern Ghats and the Deccan Plateau
						up to Bay of Bengal. However most of the flows occur only in 3 to
						4 months of South West monsoon i.e., June to September. The annual
						rainfall is between 900 to 1500 mm in northern Telangana and 700
						to 900 mm.
Telangana is a riverine state with major, medium and minor
						rivers. Of these two are major interstate rivers i.e., 1.Godavari
						and 2.Krishna. Godavari and Krishna flow through the heart of the
						state. Total water allocated to Projects in Telangana in Krishna
						basin is 299 TMC and Godavari basin is 954.23 TMC. Apart from the
						2 major rivers, there are other 9 Nos. of small rivers such as
						Bhima, Dindi, Kinnerasani, Manjeera, Manair, Penganga, Pranahita,
						Peddavagu and Taliperu.
Telangana has a heritage of cultivation and irrigation
						dating back to several centuries. In the past, ancient Kings and
						rulers built lakes and reservoirs by constructing bunds and
						anicuts across rivers for creating irrigation potential as well as
						drinking water for the people. Big lakes like Ramappa, Pakhal,
						Laknavaram and many other irrigation works of Kakatiya period have
						become names to remember and are serving till today. The Mir Alam
						Tank is the finest example in arched dam constructed across Musi
						River. The GhanapurAnicut across Manjira with two canals called
						Fathenahar and Mahabobnahar, Pocharamlake, Osmansagar,
						Himayatsagar, Nizamsagar Project, Mannair Project, Dindi Project,
						Palair Project, Wyra Project and Sarlasagar Projects are some of
						the magnificent contributions of the eminent Engineers of
						Hyderabad State under Nawab Ali Nawaz Jung Bahadur and other
						eminent Engineers during the Nizam's kingdom in Telangana.

A screen reader is a software application that enables people with
				severe visual impairments to use a computer. Screen readers work
				closely with the computer Operating System (OS) to provide
				information about icons, menus, dialogue boxes, files and folders. A
				screen reader provides access to the entire OS that it works with,
				including many common applications.
A screen reader uses a Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine to
					translate on-screen information into speech, which can be heard
					through earphones or speakers. A TTS may be a software application
					that comes bundled with the screen reader, or it may be a hardware
					device that plugs into the computer. Originally, before computers
					had soundcards, screen readers always used hardware TTS devices,
					but now that soundcards come as standard on all computers many find
					that a software TTS is preferable. In addition to speech feedback,
					screen readers are also capable of providing information in
					Braille. An external hardware device, known as a refreshable
					Braille display is needed for this. A refreshable Braille display
					contains one or more rows of cells. Each cell can be formed into
					the shape of a Braille character, a series of dots that are similar
					to domino dots in their layout. As the information on the computer
					screen changes, so does the Braille characters on the display
					change, providing refreshable information directly from the
					computer. Whilst it is possible to use either format independently,
					Braille output is commonly used in conjunction with speech output.

తెలంగాణ సమగ్ర అభివృద్ధి కోసం మనకు లభ్యమవుతున్న నీటి వనరులను ఉపయోగించుకొని వ్యవసాయ రంగం,పారిశ్రామిక రంగాన్ని పటిష్టం చేసుకుంటూ ప్రతి కుటుంబానికి తాగు నీటిని సమకూర్చటం ఈ శాఖ యొక్క విధి మరియు బాధ్యత .
						దీనికి గాను వివిధ సాగునీటి వివిధ సాగునీటి ప్రాజెక్టులను అమలు చేయడం లో సాగునీటి శాఖ ఒక ముఖ్య భూమిక  పోషిస్తుంది.
అనావృష్టిపీడిత ప్రాంతాలు, మెత్త ప్రాంతాలకు సాగునీటి పారుదల సామర్ధ్యాన్ని ఏర్పాటు చేయడం, నీటి వినియోగ సామర్ధ్యాన్ని పెంచడంతో పాటు నీటి యూనిట్ ఒక్కింటికి వ్యవసాయ ఉత్పాదకత పెంచేందుకు ప్రస్తుతం 
						ఉన్న ప్రాజెక్టులను పరిరక్షించుకోడం  అనేది తెలంగాణలో సాగునీటి పారుదల శాఖ ప్రధానోదేశంగా ఉన్నది.
తెలంగాణ ప్రాంతంలో సాగునీటి అభివృద్ధి గోదావరి, కృష్ణనదులు, వాటి ఉపనదులు, చెరువుల సరస్సులపై ప్రధానంగా ఆధారపడుతున్నది. తెలంగాణ  ప్రాంతంలో చెరువులు అత్యంత ప్రధానమైన వనరులుగా ఉన్నాయి. భారీ చెరువుల నుండి చిన్న కుంటలు, ఇంకుడు చెరువులు అన్ని కలుపుకొని 46 ,531  నీటి వనరులు ఉన్నాయి. ఈ చెరువులను పునరుద్ధరించి, పునర్జీవింప  చేయడానికి, రాష్ట్ర సర్వతోముఖాభివృద్ధికి రెండు నదుల నీటిని వినియోగించడానికి రాష్ట్ర ప్రభుత్వం అనేక చర్యలు చేపట్టింది.ఈ లక్ష్యాన్ని సాధించడానికి 
						గోదావరి మరియు కృష్ణనదులలో ఆధారపడదగ్గ జలాలు, మిగులు వరద నీటిని సంపూర్ణంగా వినియోగించాలని ప్రభుత్వం ప్రాజెక్టులను రూపొందిస్తుంది
ఈ క్రింద విధముగా ప్రోజెక్టుల క్రింద సాగునీటి పారుదల ఆయకట్టు ఆధారంగా సాగునీటి పారుదల ప్రాజెక్టులన్నింటినీ వర్గీకరించడం జరిగింది.

వీటికి అదనంగా రాష్ట్రంలోని ఆయకట్టు ప్రాంత అభివృద్ధి పనులు, వరద నియంత్రణ పనులను కూడా పర్యవేక్షిస్తుంది.
రాష్ట్రంలో కొనసాగుతున్న ప్రాజెక్టులను త్వరగా  పూర్తి  చేయడానికి, ప్రస్తుతం ఉన్న సాగునీటి ప్రాజెక్టులను ఆధునీకరించడానికి గాను ఆర్ఐడిఎఫ్ (నాబార్డు), 
						జెఐసిఎ (జపాన్ అంతర్జాతహేయ సహకార సంస్థ), భారత ప్రభుత్వం త్వరిత గతిన ప్రయోజన కార్యక్రమం   (ఎఐబిపి) మరియు సాధారణ రాష్ట్ర ప్రణాళికకు అదనంగా 
						ప్రపంచబ్యాంకు నుండి ఆర్ధిక సహాయాన్ని స్వీకరించడం జరుగుతున్నది.
సాగునీటి శాఖ ప్రధాన విధులు
1.	సాగు తదితర ప్రయోజనాల కోసం నీటిని కేటాయించడంతో పాటు నదీ బేసిన్లలో నీటి లభ్యతను హైడ్రొలోజికల్ మదింపు చేయడం.
2.   సాగునీటి పారుదల వ్యవస్థను ప్రణాళికాబద్ధంగా రూపకల్పన చేయడం.
3.   రాష్ట్ర ఆర్ధిక అభివృద్ధి కోసం సాగునీటి సామర్ధ్యాన్ని ఏర్పాటు చేయడానికి కొత్త ప్రాజెక్టులు నిర్మించడం.
4.   పురాతన ప్రాజెక్టులు పునఃనిర్మించడం ద్వారా ప్రస్తుత ఆయకట్టుము స్థిరీకరించడం.
5.   పురాతన భారీ, మధ్య తరహా సాగునీటి ప్రాజెక్టులను ఆధునీకరించడం.
6.   సంభందిత  శాఖలన్నీ  ఏకీకృత, సహకార ప్రయత్నాల ద్వారా నీటి యాజమాన్యాన్ని, నీటి వినియోగ సామర్ధ్యాన్ని మెరుగుపరచడం.
7.   ప్రస్తుత సాగునీటి ప్రోజెక్టుల కోసం నిర్వహణ అమలు, నిర్వహణ ప్రణాలికను తాయారు చేయడం.
8.   వరద నిర్వహణ.
9.   వరద గట్ల పునరుద్ధరణ మరియు నిర్వహణ
10.  పారిశ్రామిక, తదితర వినియోగాల కోసం సాగునీటి పారుదల ప్రాంతాన్ని మదింపు చేయడం, నీటి రాయల్టీ చార్జీలను మదింపు చేయడం.
11.  నీటి లభ్యతపై సమాచారం, విశ్లేషలను సమర్పించడం, అంతర్ రాష్ట్ర నదీ బేసిన్లను   వినియోగించడం, సంబంధిత ఆయా ట్రిబ్యునళ్లకు    సమాచారాన్ని   అందచేయడం
12.  కొత్త ప్రాజెక్టు ఆయాకట్లను అన్వేషించడం
శాఖ వ్యవస్థీకృత ఏర్పాటు :
తెలంగాణ రాష్ట్రం ఏర్పడిన తర్వాత అవసరాలకు అనుగుణంగా మరియు ప్రభుత్వ విధానాల ప్రకారం ప్రస్తుతమున్న యూనిట్లను సృష్టించడం ద్వారా
					 సాగునీటి పారుదల మరియు సిఏడి డిపార్టుమెంటును బలోపేతం చేయడం జరిగినది.
