Plastic is every where
Our environment needs natural  space just like us to maintain balance  and it is already on the verge of losing it with usage of plastic in form of bottles, bags,  wrappers etc.
It Takes 1000 years to decompose  plastic into smaller pieces,  which seep  down into the soil and release chemicals, which  eventually reach the water supply.
Tens of thousands of  sea animals are killed every  year from plastic  bag litter in the marine  environment
GHMC proposes to ban usage of Single  use plastic and to replace  it with more environmentally sustainable  materials.
The sooner we do it, the better it will be for us.
Mall Owners, Big shoppers, Plastic manufacturers  have been instructed  to use alternate to single use  plastic bags.
Shopkeepers could also keep Jute
I
A collective action  of the sellers  and the buyers can help the environment in sustaining  its balance.
GHMC through Self Help Groups (SHGs) are making Jute Bags which GHMC promotes for daily usage at retail stores and other daily activities.

The Electronic filing has many advantages.
                It increased the speed with which applications can be filed
                facilitated 24 X 7 file movement
                making it possible to receive files on days the office is officially closed
                extending the time for moving files on any given day till midnight
                In fact, the eOffice has proved to be a game-changer in GHMC.
                The eOffice has scaled down the use of paper drastically, contributing to the cause of environment protection
                Now, the GHMC Commissioners Desk itself is devoid of any papers and heaps of files
                In the next phase, the new facility would be made use to track the movements of the officials during field visits especially inspection of buildings to issue building permissions, assessment of PT, redressal of infrastructure related grievances, etc, by linking all the existing GHMC application modules to eOffice
                There are about 7500 regular functionaries at various levels, besides about 25,000 outsourced personnel working across various wings
                The Commissioner, GHMC as the head of this huge organization will receive about 250 to 300 files per day on an average
                Timely disposal of these files proved to be vary crucial the Commissioners table is saddled with heaps of files giving an awkward look

City History
Hyderabad is the capital of Telangana state and temporary capital of Andhra Pradesh state. The city, founded in the year 1591 by Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah, the fifth sultan of Qutb Shahi dynasty, offers a fascinating panorama of the past, with richly mixed cultural and historical tradition spanning over 400 years. It is one of the fastest growing cities of India and has emerged as a strong industrial, commercial, technology center, gives a picture of glimpses of past splenders and the legacy of its old history.The history of Hyderabad begins with the establishment of the Qutb Shahi dynasty. Quli Qutb Shah seized the reins of power from the Bahamani kingdom in 1512 and established the fortress city of Golconda. Inadequacy of water, and frequent epidemics of plague and cholera persuaded Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah to venture outward to establish new city with the Charminar at its centre and with four great roads fanning out four cardinal directions. Hyderabad's fame, strategic location and Golconda's legendary wealth attracted Aurangazeb who captured Golconda after a long seize in 1687.
After this defeat the importance of Hyderabad declined and the city fell into partial ruins. As the Moghul empire decayed and began to disintegrate, the viceroy, Asaf Jah I proclaimed himself the Nizam and established independence rule of the Deccan. Hyderabad once again became a major capital city, ruled by successive Nizams of the Asaf Jahi dynasty until the state was merged into Indian Union in 1948.
SECUNDERABAD: In 1798, a subsidiary alliance for military and political cooperation was signed between the Nizam and the British East India company. There after an area north of what is now the Hussain Sagar was established as a cantonment. The area was named Secunderabad after the then Nizam, Sikander Jah.
From nawabs and pearls to the world's hi-tech happening point, the city's journey is fascinating. The sprawling metropolis is coming to terms with itself at the start of the new millenium. The Qutb Shahi dynasty founded the Kingdom of Golconda, one of the five kingdoms that emerged after the break up of the Bahamani Kingdom. The Qutb Shahis ruled the Deccan for almost 171 years.All the seven rulers were patrons of learning and were great builders. They contributed to the growth and development of Indo-Persian and Indo-Islamic literature and culture in Hyderabad. During the Qutb Shahi reign Golconda became one of the leading markets in the world of diamonds, pearls, steel for arms, and also printed fabric. The glory of the Golconda kingdom ended in 1687, after a valiant struggle. Aurangzeb, the last great Mughal ruler, captured Golconda after a siege that lasted eight months.
Abul Hasan Tana Shah, the last king of Golconda, was imprisoned at Daulatabad, where he died after twelve years in captivity. With the conquest of the Deccan and the South, Aurangzeb succeeded in expanding the Mughal Empire to cover the entire sub-continent. However, after his death in 1707, the Empire rapidly declined. At that time , the Deccan was administered by a Subedar or viceroy of the Mughal Emperor. Mir Quamaruddin, the Governor of the Deccan, who bore the title of Nizam-ul-Mulk Feroze Jung Asif Jah, declared his independence from Mughal rule in 1724.He thus became the first Nizam and the founder of the Asif Jahi dynasty. Asif Jah I continued to maintain Aruangabad, which had been founded by the Mughal rulers as the capital of his new state. In 1769, Nizam Ali Khan Asif Jah II, shifted the capital to Hyderabad. The seven Nizam's of the Asif Jahi dynasty ruled the Deccan for nearly 224 years, right up to 1948. During the Asif Jahi period, Persian, Urdu, Telugu and Marathi developed simultaneously. The highest official positions were given to deserving persons irrespective of their religion.
Persian was the official language up to 1893 and then Urdu up to 1948. When the British and the French spread their hold over the country, the Nizam soon won their friendship without bequeathing his power. The title "Faithful. Ally of the British Government" was bestowed on Nizam VII. The British stationed a Resident at Hyderabad, but the state continued to be ruled by the Nizam. The rule of the seven Nizam's saw the growth of Hyderabad both culturally and economically. Huge reservoirs, like the Nizam Sagar, Tungabadra, Osman Sagar, Himayath Sagar, and others were built. Survey work on Nagarjuna Sagar had also begun during this time. Hyderabad, under the Nizam's, was the largest princely state in India. Area wise it was as big as England and Scotland put together. The State had its own currency, mint, railways, and postal system. There was no income tax. Soon after India gained independence, Hyderabad State merged with the Union of India. On November 1, 1956 the map of India was redrawn into linguistic states, and Hyderabad became the capital of Andhra Pradesh.
Telangana state came into existence on June 2nd 2014 with Hyderabad as the capital city.
