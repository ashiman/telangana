T-Works
Website:
www.tworks.telangana.gov.in
T-Works India’s largest prototyping centre for electronics, electromechanical and mechanical start-ups.
Executive Summary
The differentiation between hardware and software is diminishing. Moving forward, hardware will be an indispensable component in product development because of the advent of IoT and other technologies.
Telangana is one of the most preferred IT destinations in India, ranking second in terms of IT exports. The Government strives to further strengthen this position and establish itself as the most preferred technology investment destination in the country, not only in the area of IT/ITeS but also in Electronics.
In order to create an ecosystem of product development and manufacturing in electronics, electromechanical and mechanical domains, the ITE&C Department of Telangana State proposes to set up a world class prototyping facility, along with an incubation centre and a skill development centre. This facility is called T-Works.
Vision:
Objectives
Facilitate entrepreneurs to design, develop, and test innovative hardware products in the areas of electronics, mechanical, mechatronics through active collaboration with industry, academia, investors, experts, and other stakeholders.
Facilitate hardware startups to scale through active collaboration with manufacturing services.
Facilitate talent development and up-skilling to produce talented workforce for hardware startups and manufacturing industry.
T-Works is a 50,000 sq. ft. dedicated incubation facility for hardware makers and entrepreneurs located in Hyderabad.
In addition to developing new infrastructure, T-Works will foster an ecosystem for hardware products by leveraging the existing manufacturing and prototyping infrastructure available across the region. This includes creating a dense and networked ecosystem of manufacturing service providers.
Guiding Principles
T-Works gives fair and non-discriminatory access of its prototyping equipment in the domains of mechanical, electromechanical, electronics to inventors, creators, hobbyists, students, entrepreneurs and businesses
T-Works provides prototyping facilities – mentoring – skill development programs – incubating facilities – sourcing services – funding opportunities in that order of priority so that no succeeding function dilutes the preceding function
T-Works shall not be used to mass-manufacture
T-Works shall not hold equity in any of the companies or business entities that it works with, mentors, or incubates
T-Works shall not be in the business of holding, creating, or selling intellectual property
T-Works shall be responsible for and own all the equipment, tools, and software on its premises
T-Works shall work towards non-discriminatory access
T-Works shall facilitate hardware startups to scale through active collaboration with manufacturing services
T-Works shall facilitate talent development and upskilling to produce talented workforce for hardware startups and manufacturing industry
Rationale
The rationale for setting up T-Works in Hyderabad can be summarized as below:
Hyderabad has a significantly strong software industry. A boost to the hardware ecosystem will strengthen our position as a hub for product startups
Hyderabad already boasts of over 1000 startups, 10+ incubators and accelerators and 15+ venture capital firms
The city also is home to India’s top educational institutions such as IIT, IIIT, BITS Pilani, ISB, NIT
Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Qualcomm, Xilinx, NVidia all have major operations located in the city. All of the above are involved in creating products at the intersection of hardware and software
The city also hosts a number of public and private research labs such as:
Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO)
Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL)
Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT)
Defence Electronics Research Laboratory (DLRL)
Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL)
Research Centre Imarat (RCI)
Tata Advanced Systems (TASL)
Saab India Technology Centre (SITC)
DuPont Ballistics Facility (DBF)
The key to success for hardware startups is quick prototype development and short time to market
Given the availability of talent and R&D infrastructure in the city, there is a need for a facility that enables prototype development and also reduces the barriers to cost and effort
In addition to promoting hardware startups and manufacturing, T-Works would spur activity in engineering services and product design services in the city

Digital Telangana
After ‘Make in India’ and ‘Clean India’ (Swachh Bharat), the Government of India has launched its 3rd major campaign, ‘Digital India’ with the objectives of
Enabling digital empowerment of citizens,
Facilitating digital infrastructure as a utility to every citizen and
Providing governance & services on demand.
Digital India was kickstarted through a week-long program starting 1st July. Under the leadership of Minister Mr. KT Rama Rao, the ITE&C Department took up a very ambitious Digital Telangana program. In fact some of the goals under Digital Telangana far exceed Digital India’s goals.
Digital Telangana stands on two pivots; each of them representing the supply and the demand side. On the supply side, the main aim is to ensure that digital facilities become available to each and every person in the state. This is being made possible through :
Laying OFC to each household using the water grid trenches
Providing 4G services in the entire state
WiFi in major cities and towns
e-Panchayat scheme under which a One Stop Shop kiosk will be available in each Panchayat
Similarly, on the demand side, the intention is to make each and every person digitally empowered so that he/she can make best use of the digital facilities that are being made available right at his/her doorstep. The strategies for this include:
Digital literacy program, under which one member of each household will be taught to become digitally literate
School computer literacy program: To teach every child from Class 6 onwards the basics of computers
Expansion of Mee-Seva services
Converting as many Mee-Seva services as possible on mobile platform and make mobile governance a reality in Digital Telangana
Identifying technology solutions for all government agencies to provide better services to the citizens
Government of Telangana has already made some progress in making the vision of Digital Telangana a reality by providing 4G services in major cities; enabling WiFi facilities at Tank Bund, Necklace Road, Charminar, Public Gardens, Railway Station, etc; expanding Mee-Seva services and working towards the goal of One Stop Shop (OSS) kiosks at each Gram Panchayat.
During the first week of July, the Department of ITE&C, with the help of other departments, has organised Digital Telangana and conducted the following programmes:
Launch of new e-services in endowments department (online payment gateways for Yadgirigutta and Bhadrachalam), agriculture department (green phablet)
Promotion of digital literacy, cyber hygiene and cyber security
Launch of biometric attendance system in Warangal District
WiFi services at Telangana University, Nizamabad

Minister releases Department’s Annual Report 2018
The annual report 2017-18 of the Information Technology, Electronics and Communications Department was released today by Sri K T Rama Rao, Hon’ble Minister for IT, Industries, MA&UD and NRI Affairs. This annual report marks the fourth year of the IT Department’s practice of putting its activities and accomplishments in the public domain and bringing in new standards of transparency and accountability into Governance.
Telangana’s IT exports have been growing at a Cumulative Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 15.6% since its formation. This is roughly 150% of the national average during the same period, with India growing at an annual rate of 10.3%. This unprecedented growth has resulted in the creation of over 1.5 lakh new IT jobs since 2014. A few salient highlights of this year are as follows-
T-Wallet
T-App Folio
T-Fibre
Innovation Cell
WE-Hub
The Hon’ble Minister also touched upon major events hosted by Hyderabad. During the last one year, Hyderabad has grown significantly to solidify its position on the global economic map. Having hosted the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES), World Congress on Information Technology, and National Conference on eGovernance, Hyderabad stands as the preferred global destination for conferences and meetings.
The event also witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement between the Government of Telangana and Data Security Council of India to set up a Centre of Excellence on Cybersecurity in Hyderabad. This CoE, the first of its kind in India, will focus on creating an ecosystem for cybersecurity R&D, product development, capacity building, and innovation.
The Annual Report launch event, in addition to recounting achievements of the last year, also saw launch of several new initiatives aligned with the vision of Digital Telangana. The Minister launched four major initiatives of Government of Telangana, namely, T-Web, TASK Mobile VAN T-SOC, T-SWAN, and TSTS ABAS.
Telangana Security Operations Centre, or T-SOC aims to secure the government data and critical infrastructure using state-of-art threat detection and response capabilities by setting up a Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) solution. In phase-1 of T-SOC, entire infrastructure of State Data Centre (SDC) and Secretariat Area Network (SCAN) has been integrated with T-SOC.
Telangana State Wide Network, or T-SWAN, marks major upgradation in the erstwhile SWAN infrastructure of Telangana. Under T-SWAN, the broadband connectivity at District HQs, and Mandal HQs has been enhanced significantly in a short span of 6 months from October 2017. The HQs of all 31 districts (earlier, 10) have been provided with 34 Mbps internet connection along with a 20 Mbps (earlier 12 Mbps) dedicated intranet connection. More importantly, the connectivity to old and new Mandal HQs has been improved from 4 Mbps to 12 Mbps bandwidth. The beneficiaries of a 200% increase in bandwidth include more than 46 government departments and 101 sub departments, MeeSeva Centres and other online services.
In a first of its kind implementation, Telangana State Technology Services has developed an Aadhaar based Attendance System, called TSTS ABAS providing all three critical components for an effective biometric based attendance system i.e. Device, Connectivity and authentication solution. Through a soft launch earlier this year, the solution has already been implemented for Students of JNTU, GHMC Sanitary workers, Property Registration, Board of Intermediate education etc. and is witnessing around 1 lakh authentications every day. The initiative is a key step towards Digital Governance.
Electronic Service Delivery is continuously looking for avenues to improve the incomes of the Mee Seva Franchsiees. As part of this ESD signed an MoU with IFFCO BAZAR, a leading e-commerce portal for agricultural inputs. Under this MoU, the farmers will be able to access IFFCO Bazar, through MeeSeva Centres, to purchase and get home delivery of agricultural inputs at no additional cost. Mee Seva Franchisees will get additional income paid by IFFCO. This is a first of its kind initiative in the country wherein the farmers can use assisted online service of Mee Seva to buy agricultural inputs through online.
The Minister concluded by saying that 2017-18 has been a phenomenal year for the ITE&C Department with numerous initiatives taking off and shaping up really well. The progress seen this year and the numerous new initiatives undertaken have laid a very strong foundation to achieve even greater results in the years to come. Internally the IT Department has set very ambitious targets for itself the coming year in its pursuit to cement Telangana’s positions as the go-to destination for technology across the globe.

Screen Reader
A screen reader is a software application that enables people with severe visual impairments to use a computer. Screen readers work closely with the computer’s Operating System (OS) to provide information about icons, menus, dialogue boxes, files and folders. A screen reader provides access to the entire OS that it works with, including many common applications.
A screen reader uses a Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine to translate on-screen information into speech, which can be heard through earphones or speakers. A TTS may be a software application that comes bundled with the screen reader, or it may be a hardware device that plugs into the computer. Originally, before computers had soundcards, screen readers always used hardware TTS devices, but now that soundcards come as standard on all computers many find that a software TTS is preferable. In addition to speech feedback, screen readers are also capable of providing information in Braille. An external hardware device, known as a refreshable Braille display is needed for this. A refreshable Braille display contains one or more rows of cells. Each cell can be formed into the shape of a Braille character, a series of dots that are similar to domino dots in their layout. As the information on the computer screen changes, so does the Braille characters on the display change, providing refreshable information directly from the computer. Whilst it is possible to use either format independently, Braille output is commonly used in conjunction with speech output.

International Blockchain Congress
Acknowledging the importance of blockchain technology in ushering transparency in transactions across sectors, Telangana State has set up Blockchain district, which will work on the protocols to be followed and also evolve new use cases for taking the technology to the masses, said Telangana Industries and IT Minister KT Rama Rao.
The new initiative, which is being taken up in a public-private partnership model, will strengthen the position of Hyderabad as a hub for deep technology, he said.
Inaugurating the maiden International Blockchain Congress at HICC here on Friday, the Minister said the State has decided to use blockchain technology to augment the credibility, accuracy, and efficiency and to arrest fraudulent transactions in land dealings.
The Government is implementing DHARANI, an integrated land record management system to develop a modern, comprehensive, transparent and near-real-time land records. This will be on the lines of a core banking solution. “DHARANI which will lead us to an era of conclusive titling, which by the way shall be a first for the nation as revenue records are meant to be presumptive in India,” he said.
The Government, before implementing the solution, undertook a gigantic exercise of cleansing or purifying the land records in 10,875 revenue villages in 568 mandals. During the extensive drive, more than 90 percent of land details were recorded and computerised. “Buoyed by this success, we are also planning to carry out this exercise in urban areas too,” the minister said.
The underlying technology of blockchain makes it a potential candidate for many non-financial purposes. Healthcare, retail, real estate, insurance, transportation, health records, voting in elections, peer-to-peer energy transactions, tax and welfare payments are some of the uses, he said.
“Telangana is initiating pilot projects to secure 10th grade and plus two certificates issued to students. The certificates’ transaction data will be stored on blockchain and the external user agencies such as other universities, banks, government agencies or any private organisations offering employment can verify the data submitted by the students against the data stored in the blockchain,” he said.
It will use the technology platform to create a robust ecosystem that tracks the entire lifecycle of the vehicle from manufacturer-dealer-buyers-sellers -insurance and vehicle service companies to scrap. In addition, the State also launched a pilot to track the transactions of chit funds (a saving financial instrument) that will protect the interest of subscribers.
“We are preparing to seize the new opportunities and we are in the process of building our in-house expertise in emerging technologies, fostering partnerships with industry and collaborating with start-ups to drive of emerging tech-based solutions within the government departments and public-facing projects,” Rao said.
“The world is moving into the Fourth industrial Revolution and India has missed the earlier three industrial revolutions. This time, we are not going to miss this ‘Digital Revolution’, in which we have proved our expertise to the world,” he added.

Sixty Mee Seva centres to dispense cash
Sixty Mee Seva centres to dispense cash from today Pilot project to go on stream in four districts
Mee Seva centres in the State will now become cash withdrawal centres, besides continuing to provide other services that are provided online now, if the initiative of the IT department takes a concrete shape.
The Government is set to introduce the first-of-its-kind Aadhaar-enabled Payment System in Mee Seva centres from Monday.
The AePS has been conceptualised to allow citizens to use Aadhaar as identity to access their bank accounts and withdraw cash through secure authentication through biometrics at Mee Seva centres.
All that the users will have to give is their Aadhaar number, bank name, account number and citizen biometric authentication to withdraw cash from their Aadhaar-linked bank accounts. The service is being rolled out in 60 Mee Seva centres — 15 each in Nizamabad, Karimnagar, Khammam and Mahabubnagar — and will be extended to cover all the 4,500-plus centres in due course.
Cash limit during the pilot project is being restricted to ₹2,000 and would be extended to Rs.10,000 in the coming days and the entire operation comes free of charge.
Agreement
An agreement to this effect has been reached between the Electronic Service Delivery (ESD) wing of the Information Technology department, the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) and Kotak Mahindra Bank.
The NCPI has, accordingly, integrated the Mee Seva centres in its payment gateway while the Kotak Mahindra Bank would provide the AePS solutions at the Mee Seva centres, allowing people to withdraw cash from them.
The ESD is currently serving over 1.5 lakh people, providing close to 600 services of 38 departments through a network of more than 4,500 Mee Seva centres on a daily basis.
The AePS service, according to senior officials, has been contemplated for the convenience of consumers in the rural areas where the number of bank branches and ATMs is relatively less. The service is expected to provide banking services in the close vicinity of citizens, saving time and avoiding transport-related expenses to users.

IT and Industrial corridor Pylon Inauguration in Mahabubnagar
At least 15,000 direct job openings in the corridor and another 20,000 indirect job openings for local youth from Palamuru region would be generated once the corridor becomes fully operational.
Minister for IT and Industries K Taraka Rama Rao has agreed to sanction Rs 50 crore to build an IT tower at the 400-acre IT and multi-purpose industrial corridor in Divitipally on the outskirts of Mahabubnagar town.
Addressing a huge gathering at the pylon inauguration of the IT and industrial corridor at Divitipally on Saturday, Rama Rao said at least 15,000 direct job openings in the corridor and another 20,000 indirect job openings for local youth from Palamuru region would be generated once the corridor becomes fully operational.
“Palamuru used to be a region from where annually 14 lakh people used to migrate to various parts of India for work. This day will be remembered and recalled by the people of the region because this is a historic move to ensure jobs for skilled youth in the region,” he said.
Minister Sri Laxma Reddy, Mahabubnagar MP Sri Jithender Reddy, MLAs Sri V Srinivas Goud and Sri Guvvala Balaraju, Sri Alla Venkateshwar Reddy, TSIIC MD EV Narasimha Reddy and District Collector Ronald Ross participated.

How Telangana is using technology to transform its economy
The state of Telangana, the country’s newest and 10th largest, emerged from its bifurcation with erstwhile Andhra Pradesh with a challenge: one of deep economic divide and low growth.
The state of Telangana, the country’s newest and 10th largest, emerged from its bifurcation with erstwhile Andhra Pradesh with a challenge: one of deep economic divide and low growth — the reasons why the division took place in the first place. But the TRS government has pulled out all stops in order to boost growth, using technology as a key enabler to improve productivity, transparency and ease of doing business, says a report by brokerage firm Religare.
Economists from the firm recently undertook a three-day road trip to the state (visiting districts Hyderabad, Nizamabad and Zaheerabad) meeting companies, dealers, farmers and government officials. The takeaways: consumption is strong, the government has a strong industrial policy in place, and technology is playing a big role in the state’s transformation.
“The slowdown that one has seen [in broader rural India] hasn’t played out as much for Telangana. The state effected a 43 percent hike for government employees. This helped boost consumption,” Religare Institutional Research Chief India Economist Jay Shankar told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.
He said that Hyderabad’s rise as a technology and business hub has helped policymakers frame pro-investment rules.
“This will go a long way in industrialising other districts of Telangana,” he said.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Jay Shankar’s interview with Sonia Shenoy & Reema Tendulkar on CNBC-TV
18.
Reema: Could you walk us through what your key takeaways are from the three day road trip to Telangana?
A:
Latha: Salary hikes in what. Was it private sector, public sector?
Latha: When the two states were bifurcated, the big fear was that Telangana is the poorer cousin which us why they were asking for bifurcation and the investments in Telangana had come from Andhra Pradesh guys. Is there any fear that Andhra Pradesh will deindustrialise Hyderabad or Telangana?
Reema: That is really good to hear the kind of role technology as well as the pick up that we have seen in business, the ease of doing business in Telangana but when you speak to your colleagues in the team which is the best way to play this Telangana consumer demand story in terms of sectors as well as stocks?
I do acknowledge that the selection of the district as well as the meetings may not be as randomised as you would want to; well it is not a survey but we just go and meet people randomly. Not that randomly as one would want to. However, the kind of feedback we got from other dealers as well, for example the cement demand; cement demand has picked up significantly; demand for pipes also, so we met the Finolex people, the distributor over there. Cement demands especially from institution; the institutional part of the demand has picked big time versus the retail demand.
Latha: I have two questions. One, the real estate space in Hyderabad, it was at one point in time the haven for real estate guys and thereafter prices plateaued even dropped. Has that market improved? Could you see those signs and separately cement a lot of cement demand was expected from both the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Did you notice those strengths?
Both the users as well as the dealers of, for example the TMT iron rod and also cement. There is a lot of demand which is now picking up especially from the builder community. So, the prices have not really started picking up that dramatically but there is a sense of pickup in demand and hence the prices, what they were expecting in the next 12 months is to increase by 10-15 percent over the next 12-14 months.
Latha: You have done a lot of rural state trips. What is the sense you are getting, after two poor monsoons, is rural demand showing extremely weak signs, at least in Telangana you seem to be giving us a sense that demand is very robust.
Among the crops also, there is a lower weightage of food grain crops where you have the impact of procurement prices being announced and hence the prices are not freely market determined, if you like, but if you look at prices for turmeric; the turmeric mandi that we visited, the prices have shot up from Rs 6,000 per quintal to Rs 8,000 per quintal and hence the price realisation by the farmers is much higher and that in some sense cushions the lower output if you like.
On top of that, as one of the finding that we have is the role of technology itself. So, for example, the mandi that we went to in Nizamabad, there we could see that there is an online market. You cannot sell offline turmeric, offline in the sense that face to face. So, you have to put your supply, so, farmers come to the mandi, they get it weighed by government appointed person and then that gets uploaded on the portal and if you are a licensed user then you can bid for that from anywhere in the world. So, that leads to better price realisation and price discovery. Hence, I would believe that they would be getting some better pricing vis-à-vis the earlier regime.

Hyderabad pips Bengaluru to become top IT talent retainer: Belong study
In the backdrop of global tech giants setting up research centres, Hyderabad maintaining its top status on the ease of doing business (EoDB) index and a general wave of business optimism surrounding the city, the latest Belong report has found that the city trumps Bengaluru when it comes to employee retention.
Belong carried a head-on-head comparison between Hyderabad and Bengaluru for employee retention and found that companies in Hyderabad see 40-60 percent less employee attrition compared to Bengaluru.
For the purpose of this study, Belong analysed last two years data of large size IT companies such as IBM, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Wells Fargo, Infosys, Amazon, Microsoft, among others. When compared to the national average, Hyderabad again fared better with 30 percent-60 percent lesser attrition rate.
“Hyderabad enjoys being one of the world’s fastest growing tech cities. Access to rich talent pool, affordable and reliable infrastructure, and a pro-business government outlook collectively make it an irresistible investment destination for both tech startups and giants alike. If people comprise 60-65 percent of a tech company’s operation cost, attracting best engineers to do the job becomes as important as the ability to retain them for longer tenures. And Hyderabad seems to be scoring well on this front by having lower attrition compared to other Indian cities,” says Phani Pattamatta, executive director of TiE Hyderabad.
Belong also compared the average salaries of employees in Hyderabad and Bengaluru for emerging skills. It found that the average salaries for hard-to-hire roles like Data Scientists and UI/UX Designers was 10-20 percent lesser in Hyderabad compared to Bengaluru.
In the last few years, factors such as lower cost of living, ease of doing business, cheaper real estate, better roads and infrastructure, and lesser traffic compared to other the metros have attracted the who’s who of the tech giants to set up their offices in Hyderabad. This includes Google, Amazon, Uber and Facebook to name a few.
Belong said in a statement, “And in the wake of Telangana’s formation in 2014 and KT Rama Rao taking over as the IT Minister, Hyderabad has been making the right noises when it comes to the IT ecosystem. It’s also home to India’s largest incubation centre – T-Hub.”
“For many years now we have always heard that Hyderabad is touted to be India’s next Silicon Valley. But now for the first time we have data to prove that it is a more viable option for tech companies because of higher retention and comparatively lower salaries owing to lower cost of living,” said Rishabh Kaul, co-founder, Belong.

Press Release
Hyderabad’s IMAGE Tower to be India’s largest animation industry: KTR
The IMAGE Tower (Innovation in Multimedia, Animation, Gaming & Entertainment) is all set to make Hyderabad the preferred destination for animation, visual effects, gaming and comics industry.
“IMAGE Tower is going to be the country’s largest such facility in terms of size with 1.6 million sqft and I hope it would be able to come out with our own DreamWorks Animation and Disney”, said Minister for Information Technology K T Rama Rao.
Speaking at the 10th year celebrations of Chhota Bheem, an Indian animated television series here on Monday, Rao said that there are many studios across the globe but what would be a truly redefining moment for Indian animation industry is when someone like Rajiv Chilaka builds India’s own DreamWorks Animation and Disney.
“Coming up with not just one character, or not one entity, or not just one series, but truly coming out with a product or studio which can literally take huge animation industry across the world and that is when we truly make a mark in animation industry and Rajiv Chilaka has the ability to do it”, he said.
Talking about Chhota Bheem, he said that his children are fans of this series and even he is well aware of all the characters in it and Kalia is his favourite. “Makers are not only able to capture the imagination of children but have come out with a character which lets parents leave their kids in comfort while watching it”.
Having debuted in 2008 on kids entertainment channel Pogo, Chhota Bheem celebrated one decade in television.
Rajiv Chilaka said it took five years to make the idea work. It became a game changer in Indian animation industry, he said, while adding that it began as a small step and went on to become 16,000 plus minutes content.

IT giant Infosys to upscale its workforce from 20K to 40K at Hyd
At a time when fear of retrenchment hangs fire over techies across the country, IT giant Infosys will upscale its workforce from present 20,000 to 40,000 employees at Hyderabad’s Pocharam campus. This was announced by Telangana minister for IT, KT Rama Rao, on Friday.
Speaking to media, Infosys corporate communication official confirmed the company’s plans to increase workforce as quoted by the minister and said that Phase-II of its workspace is coming up in the Pocharam campus which will accommodate 20,000 employees. However, the official declined to comment when asked about a deadline.
The minister was speaking at an event organized by Infosys to observe World Environment Day at its Pocharam campus.
He also requested Chief Operating Officer(COO) of Infosys, Praveen Rao, who was present at the event, to develop another campus at Warangal. Rama Rao informed that two other IT companies, Tech Mahindra and Cyient are also setting up their campus in Warangal, which has 16 engineering colleges and a National Institute of Technology. Rama Rao said that Hyderabad-Warangal is an important industrial corridor and Warangal is shaping up, like how Mysuru is to Bengaluru.
To this, the Infosys COO said that the company will definitely take a look at it and establish a campus, as long as an ecosystem is in place for it. He added that Infosys is interested in setting up its campuses in Tier-II cities, which will also help in cutting down migration to larger cities.
Speaking on complaints regarding lack of proper road between entrance of the Pocharam SEZ where Infosys is located to its campus, Rama Rao, promised that money from HMDA will be utilized to improve the road. He also informed Infosys employees present at the event that commute time taken to their office from Uppal will shorten once the Uppal to Narapally skyway, at a cost of about Rs 1,400 crore is completed in the next 1.5 years and that MMTS service connecting Hyderabad to Yadadri will be passing close to the Infosys campus.
The minister added that more than 40 percent of the workforce working in IT companies in the country are people from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and they would like to work in Hyderabad if the company increases its workforce in Hyderabad.

Acknowledging the importance of blockchain technology in ushering transparency in transactions across sectors, Telangana State has set up Blockchain district, which will work on the protocols to be followed and also evolve new use cases for taking the technology to the masses, said Telangana Industries and IT Minister KT Rama Rao.
The new initiative, which is being taken up in a public-private partnership model, will strengthen the position of Hyderabad as a hub for deep technology, he said.
Inaugurating the maiden International Blockchain Congress at HICC here on Friday, the Minister said the State has decided to use blockchain technology to augment the credibility, accuracy, and efficiency and to arrest fraudulent transactions in land dealings.
The Government is implementing DHARANI, an integrated land record management system to develop a modern, comprehensive, transparent and near-real-time land records. This will be on the lines of a core banking solution. “DHARANI which will lead us to an era of conclusive titling, which by the way shall be a first for the nation as revenue records are meant to be presumptive in India,” he said.
The Government, before implementing the solution, undertook a gigantic exercise of cleansing or purifying the land records in 10,875 revenue villages in 568 mandals. During the extensive drive, more than 90 percent of land details were recorded and computerised. “Buoyed by this success, we are also planning to carry out this exercise in urban areas too,” the minister said.
The underlying technology of blockchain makes it a potential candidate for many non-financial purposes. Healthcare, retail, real estate, insurance, transportation, health records, voting in elections, peer-to-peer energy transactions, tax and welfare payments are some of the uses, he said.
“Telangana is initiating pilot projects to secure 10th grade and plus two certificates issued to students. The certificates’ transaction data will be stored on blockchain and the external user agencies such as other universities, banks, government agencies or any private organisations offering employment can verify the data submitted by the students against the data stored in the blockchain,” he said.
It will use the technology platform to create a robust ecosystem that tracks the entire lifecycle of the vehicle from manufacturer-dealer-buyers-sellers -insurance and vehicle service companies to scrap. In addition, the State also launched a pilot to track the transactions of chit funds (a saving financial instrument) that will protect the interest of subscribers.
“We are preparing to seize the new opportunities and we are in the process of building our in-house expertise in emerging technologies, fostering partnerships with industry and collaborating with start-ups to drive of emerging tech-based solutions within the government departments and public-facing projects,” Rao said.
“The world is moving into the Fourth industrial Revolution and India has missed the earlier three industrial revolutions. This time, we are not going to miss this ‘Digital Revolution’, in which we have proved our expertise to the world,” he added.

Minister releases Department’s Annual Report 2018
Fri, 01 Jun 2018 12:28:50 +0000
http://it.telangana.gov.in/?p=5833
The annual report 2017-18 of the Information Technology, Electronics and Communications Department was released today by Sri K T Rama Rao, Hon’ble Minister for IT, Industries, MA&UD and NRI Affairs. This annual report marks the fourth year of the IT Department’s practice of putting its activities and accomplishments in the public domain and bringing in new standards of transparency and accountability into Governance.
Telangana’s IT exports have been growing at a Cumulative Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 15.6% since its formation. This is roughly 150% of the national average during the same period, with India growing at an annual rate of 10.3%. This unprecedented growth has resulted in the creation of over 1.5 lakh new IT jobs since 2014. A few salient highlights of this year are as follows-
T-Wallet
T-App Folio
T-Fibre
Innovation Cell
WE-Hub
The Hon’ble Minister also touched upon major events hosted by Hyderabad. During the last one year, Hyderabad has grown significantly to solidify its position on the global economic map. Having hosted the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES), World Congress on Information Technology, and National Conference on eGovernance, Hyderabad stands as the preferred global destination for conferences and meetings.
The event also witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement between the Government of Telangana and Data Security Council of India to set up a Centre of Excellence on Cybersecurity in Hyderabad. This CoE, the first of its kind in India, will focus on creating an ecosystem for cybersecurity R&D, product development, capacity building, and innovation.
The Annual Report launch event, in addition to recounting achievements of the last year, also saw launch of several new initiatives aligned with the vision of Digital Telangana. The Minister launched four major initiatives of Government of Telangana, namely, T-Web, TASK Mobile VAN T-SOC, T-SWAN, and TSTS ABAS.
Telangana Security Operations Centre, or T-SOC aims to secure the government data and critical infrastructure using state-of-art threat detection and response capabilities by setting up a Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) solution. In phase-1 of T-SOC, entire infrastructure of State Data Centre (SDC) and Secretariat Area Network (SCAN) has been integrated with T-SOC.
Telangana State Wide Network, or T-SWAN, marks major upgradation in the erstwhile SWAN infrastructure of Telangana. Under T-SWAN, the broadband connectivity at District HQs, and Mandal HQs has been enhanced significantly in a short span of 6 months from October 2017. The HQs of all 31 districts (earlier, 10) have been provided with 34 Mbps internet connection along with a 20 Mbps (earlier 12 Mbps) dedicated intranet connection. More importantly, the connectivity to old and new Mandal HQs has been improved from 4 Mbps to 12 Mbps bandwidth. The beneficiaries of a 200% increase in bandwidth include more than 46 government departments and 101 sub departments, MeeSeva Centres and other online services.
In a first of its kind implementation, Telangana State Technology Services has developed an Aadhaar based Attendance System, called TSTS ABAS providing all three critical components for an effective biometric based attendance system i.e. Device, Connectivity and authentication solution. Through a soft launch earlier this year, the solution has already been implemented for Students of JNTU, GHMC Sanitary workers, Property Registration, Board of Intermediate education etc. and is witnessing around 1 lakh authentications every day. The initiative is a key step towards Digital Governance.
Electronic Service Delivery is continuously looking for avenues to improve the incomes of the Mee Seva Franchsiees. As part of this ESD signed an MoU with IFFCO BAZAR, a leading e-commerce portal for agricultural inputs. Under this MoU, the farmers will be able to access IFFCO Bazar, through MeeSeva Centres, to purchase and get home delivery of agricultural inputs at no additional cost. Mee Seva Franchisees will get additional income paid by IFFCO. This is a first of its kind initiative in the country wherein the farmers can use assisted online service of Mee Seva to buy agricultural inputs through online.
The Minister concluded by saying that 2017-18 has been a phenomenal year for the ITE&C Department with numerous initiatives taking off and shaping up really well. The progress seen this year and the numerous new initiatives undertaken have laid a very strong foundation to achieve even greater results in the years to come. Internally the IT Department has set very ambitious targets for itself the coming year in its pursuit to cement Telangana’s positions as the go-to destination for technology across the globe.

Telangana is a state of start-ups: Minister KT Rama Rao
What happens when a room full of start-ups meets a minister who loves talking about start-ups, technology that drive industries and calls his state a ‘start-up state’ having a government which thinks like a start-up? You get The New Indian Express’ edex 40 Under 40 Start-up Awards, which had Minister K T Rama Rao in full swing. Questions of all sorts – inquisitive, critical, probing and even downright quirky were thrown at IT, Industries, Municipal and Urban Development Minister KT Rama Rao who conducted a town hall as the centerpiece of the entrepreneurship summit, for which the minister was chief guest.
When a young entrepreneur from Hyderabad, whose start-up has developed an air conditioned helmet asked the minister as to what kind of support the government plans to provide entrepreneurs looking to move out of incubators and scale up, Rao was quick in answering as he spelt out a new programme called ‘Pink book’, a “yellow pages for start-ups”. Rao said that the Pink book will be a comprehensive list of manufacturers working in various industrial sectors, a sort of a directory, which can be referred to by any Indian or a foreign company looking to collaborate and manufacture in the state.
A woman entrepreneur from Vanasthalipuram present in the audience, who did not pose a question heaped praises on the Telangana government for making the city safe for women even at night, especially traveling through Hyderabad Metro Rail, Rao thanked her and announced that metro rail from LB Nagar will be inaugurated next month.
TNIE Editor GS Vasu felicitated KTR on the occasion.
“She suggested that I pour out what I have in my head in the form of a story. So I sat down and wrote all my theories, except this time I did it as a story” he said. “So what were those lessons? One of them included patience where he mentioned that “everyone is lucky but to get that ‘bloody good luck’, one needs to wait for the right time.’ According to Sanghi, planning and persistence are something that will keep one going in the long run. The event was sponsored by MEIL, Telangana Tourism, ICFAI Group and supported by T-Hub, Prayaana, Startup Byte and Notion Press.

Telangana pushes the pedal on IT growth
Telangana’s government has set itself a target of crossing Rs. 1,20,000 crore in IT exports by 2020
Hyderabad will also host the first edition of the International Blockchain Congress in August this year, in partnership with the NITI Aayog
India’s youngest state is all set to oust Bengaluru as the Silicon Valley of India, and if it’s FY18 annual report for the information technology sector were any indicator, then Hyderabad and the state of Telangana are on the right track.
The IT sector in Telangana grew by 9.32% in FY18, thanks to a robust investment by the industry. Exports reached a record Rs. 94,322 crore for the year, while over 43,000 jobs were added directly by IT firms at a time when pink slips have been the industry norm.
Telangana’s government has set itself a target of crossing Rs. 1,20,000 crore in IT exports by 2020, and also ensuring direct employment opportunities for at least four hundred thousand people within the same time frame.
Industry and IT minister for Telangana, KT Rama Rao, seems to be fairly confident of achieving this ambitious target, despite the state entering an election year.
“I thank all global and local IT companies for believing in Telangana. You have helped us in a big way by providing a positive buzz and participatory model where we, the government, could come in and reach out to your partners and your vendors to clock record growth,” he said.
Indian giants like Tech Mahindra, Infosys, Cyient, HCL Tech are not just looking at Hyderabad for its campuses.
Tech Mahindra and Cyient have already begun setting up of facilities in Warangal, while Infosys is currently evaluating prospects for the same and has also committed to double the headcount in its Pocharam campus in Hyderabad to 40,000 employees soon.
The state will be setting up Tech Parks in smaller cities of Nizamabad, Karimnagar and Khammam in coming years.
It’s not just Indian companies that have bet big on Hyderabad, players like Adobe, Apple, Amazon, Uber and Microsoft are looking to expand their operations here.
After successfully hosting GES (Global Entrepreneurship Summit) and the World IT Congress in Hyderabad last year, KT Rama Rao is convinced this has been made possible by a strong and stable policy environment.
“TS-iPass, T-hub, T-wallet, T-fibre and other innovative reforms by the department to ensure ease of doing business is bearing fruit in the state,” Rao added.
Hyderabad will also host the first edition of the International Blockchain Congress in August this year, in partnership with the NITI Aayog.

Telangana promoting innovation in Tier 2, 3 cities too: KT Rama Rao
Telangana, the start-up state, offers a sea of opportunities to entrepreneurs and it does not want innovation and entrepreneurship to be confined to the capital city but spread to other major cities and towns.
Speaking at a seminar on ‘40 under 40: South India’s most vibrant young entrepreneurs’, conducted by The New Indian Express on Saturday, Minister for IT, industries, municipal administration and urban development KT Rama Rao said, “We don’t want innovation to be confined to Hyderabad and are taking up programmes in a sandbox approach to promote innovation in Tier-II and Tier-III cities. The young rural people have more pain points and can think out of box more than the city-bred youth. The order of the day is social innovation and rural innovation. Telangana government is supporting social and rural innovators.”
The state government has planned IT hubs at Nizamabad, Khammam, Karimnagar and Warangal by investing `25 crore on each to spur IT-based economy in districts. It is apart from mixed IT and industrial parks planned in Mahbubnagar and Nalgonda districts.
“It is known that 90 to 95 pc of the startups fail and do not survive. But the remaining, which find success and, depending on where they are incorporated, they will create the next wave of employment. The world’s top companies and largest industries cannot cumulatively generate enough jobs. This was pointed out by former Cisco chairman John Chambers on his visit to Hyderabad for Global Entrepreneurship Summit last year, and also by established entrepreneurs and industrialists. The biggest challenge to any government or head of state is employment generation. One of the issues that dominated the Telangana movement was unemployment. The government can only fill a few hundred thousand jobs.”
About incubation space in Hyderabad, Rao said the city had the largest number of co-working spaces funded by Union government’s department of science and technology. The second phase of T-hub startup incubator of state, will be up and running in the next two years. The goal is to create at least 1 million square feet of incubation space in Hyderabad in three to four years and that would be purely in government sector, he pointed out.
To a question whether he finds it difficult to handle his Twitter account, the minister said, “Can somebody in this room help? I have a problem in filtering out hundreds of comments/tweets I get everyday, some of which are also very abusive. The problem is with picking, identifying, prioritising and coming out with response to questions that warrant immediate reply from a minister. “He was not left disappointed as a young entrepreneur rushed in from the crowd to offer help, following which he directed her to Dileep Konatham, director, digital media, IT E&C department.

Mutual tie-up proves boon for both Telangana government and start-ups
More than 14 start-ups are working with various departments in Telangana government.
Top priority of start-ups is more and quick revenue but if the government turns in as the customer, the dynamics change drastically. It is hard to get the government as a client but this is the best option ever as it gives a huge access to market. Working with the government depends on the business model of the startup because margins vary from time to time and from customer to customer.
With frugal innovations being limited to start-ups, Telangana Government is bridging this gap of technological advancements by betting on these dark horses for technologies, including Block Chain, Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Deep Analytics, among others. More than 14 start-ups are working with the government, not only with IT Department but various other departments such as Transport, Health, Tourism and Industries.
While youngsters may find it bureaucratic and time intensive to work with the government, the perks it has to offer is by far large. “A start-up could have ignored working with the government three to five years ago because they were not buying them much. If a person gets a breakthrough in any government project, the market access is outsised. The private sector cannot give such large volumes,” said B.V.R. Mohan Reddy, founder and executive chairman of Cyient and founding director of T-Hub.
To facilitate taking services from start-ups on cutting edge technology, the State Innovation Policy bypasses some rules such as track record which are followed in the conventional process of taking services from private agencies.
Dileep Konatham, Director of Digital Media, Telangana Government said, “To encourage start-ups, as per the State Innovation Policy, the government is bilaterally procuring products of relevance, bypassing the existing rules for procurement.”
Entrepreneurs pointed out that with faster implementation of technology, the start-up wave could be sustained. Furthermore, there are differences as working with bureaucrats is different compared to working with private players, especially in terms of functioning and research-level that is required.
“Getting access to government bodies has really become very amenable, especially after the startup wave has begun in India. What will help these start-ups is making the implementation as agile as the start-ups themselves with some checks and balances. When the government can implement them faster to check how it will work, that will be a real encouragement to the start-ups and the ecosystem as a whole,” Pavan Adipuram, who developed T-Chits, block chain solution for chit fund companies, said.
Minister K.T. Rama Rao had previously pointed out that it becomes expensive when a work is given to an established company but giving it to a start-up is a win-win situation. However, slow payments by the government create a trouble for start-ups after the project is delivered.
A founder of a start-up, on conditions of anonymity said, “Start-ups tend to face difficulty in raising funds for government projects. They cannot afford to invest own money as most of them are in a growing stage.”
Apart from money, continuous changes to the scope of the project, entrepreneurs believe in private companies. They have more freedom and can take over the product. But with the government, you have strict rules and regulations. The whole effort is more in government when compared to private companies.
“The scope of the project keeps changing which is called scope creep. Everything cannot be defined at the initial stage. Bureaucrats should understand the changes and pay accordingly, instead of rephrasing the words. Additionally, there are problems of payment, while everything gets done, payment doesn’t come on time,” Reddy said.

About a couple of years back, under the Digital Telangana umbrella, the Government of Telangana has launched the pilot version of Hyderabad City Wi-Fi Project. The pilot project has seen the Government partner with ISPs to provide free Wi-Fi at approximately 100 public category locations across Hyderabad. These locations include malls, tourist locations`, public offices, police stations, government schools and colleges, etc. Over the last two years, the number has more than doubled to cover about 250 locations. Given the tremendous success the pilot project has seen, the Government of Telangana has decided to scale up the project to cover more than 900 locations across Hyderabad. In fact, a separate Government Order has been brought out specifically to enable smooth execution of the program for ISPs.
Having begun execution on the project about a month back, we are on track to covering about 1000 locations under the Hyderabad City Wi-Fi Project within the next 3 weeks. The World Wi-Fi Day on 20th June, a momentous occasion, has been decided as the date to formally launch the Hyderabad City Wi-Fi Project.

HFCL Launches Optical Fiber Manufacturing Facility in Hyderabad
Himachal Futuristic Communications Limited (HFCL) on Monday launched an optical fiber manufacturing facility at Hyderabad. This facility forms part of the backward integration plan of the company for its optical fiber cable manufacturing activity. This unit will have an initial capacity of approximately six and half million fiber kilometer per annum which it plans to utilize for captive consumption. The estimated project cost of the project is INR 250 crore. The company currently manufactures optical fiber cables at its Goa plant, besides at Chennai through its subsidiary HTL Limited. The move is aimed at reducing the input cost and overcoming the domestic shortage of fiber which is 35 Mil Fiber Kms. HFCL unit was inaugurated by Hon’ble Minister Sri KT Rama Rao, Principal Secretary Sri Jayesh Ranjan, Sri Sujai Karampuri, Director (Electronics) along with other dignitaries from the state and the board members of the company.
The optical fiber is a scarce resource today in India and across the world. In itself requires thirty five million fiber kilometer per annum as of the financial year 2018. The demand for the optical fiber has increased rapidly in the last few years citing the growth of BharatNet projects, Smart-city projects and other telecom related 4G & 5G projects. The initial capacity of approximately six and half million fiber kilometer per annum would increase to approximately fifteen million fiber kilometer per annum over a period of time. The company in itself requires twelve million fiber kilometer per annum of optical fiber for its cable manufacturing. Once the captive utilization capacity is met, HFCL plans to sell the optical fiber to other companies working in the same space.
With the investment of INR 250 crore, the company proposes to employ one thousand people directly or indirectly. Moreover, with this facility and the output, it plans to serve the state led project of T-Fiber and expects the ancillaries to come to Telangana and help the state’s vision of creating a related industrial eco-system in Hyderabad and neighbouring industrial localities. With the inauguration of this optical fiber manufacturing facility, the state of Telangana is a step closer to bridge the gap of the demand and supply in the Indian optical fiber market space and boost the related ecosystem.

Press Release
Microsoft Launches Azure Powered Digital Empowerment Centers for weavers in Telangana
Sri Ronald Rose, Hon’ble Collector of Mahbubnagar, inaugurated two Digital Empowerment Centers for weavers in Narayanpet. These centers have been set up by Microsoft India as part of its Citizenship initiative in their endeavor to revive traditional forms of India’s textile heritage. The digital empowerment centers enable Telangana weavers to continue their ancient craft and earn a sustainable livelihood.
These Digital Empowerment Centers will train weavers in basic digital skills and communication & business correspondence skills, to enable the weavers to effectively position their wares for business. The centres will also help the weavers access and set up e-marketing platforms and other marketing channels. Microsoft will enable digital training through Project Sangam, a Microsoft Azure based Skill Training Platform.
In addition to digital training, Project Reweave will also help the weavers with working capital support to revive defunct looms and start production of the famed Narayanpet weave. These weavers and artisans will be provided with market linkages to market their products. They will also be trained in the use of natural dyes to enable them to make newer and sustainable handwoven products.
The Hon’ble Minister for Textiles, Sri KT Rama Rao, on the occasion of the inauguration of the digital centers said, “Digital technology is changing lives of Indians across every section of society. Working with global technology leaders like Microsoft has enabled us to bring technology to the doorsteps of our large weaver communities in the remotest districts of Telangana. The efforts by Microsoft to help revive the handloom sectors is laudable as it is preserving our country’s heritage and creating sustainable livelihoods”.
Speaking at the event, District Collector Sri Ronald Rose said “India is home to more than 470 traditional, skill-based, handloom clusters that offer the second largest employment opportunity in the country, after agriculture. However, these weaver communities are unable to sustain their livelihoods due to their unorganized nature, dispersed structure, lack of education and disassociation from modern technologies. These initiatives from Companies like Microsoft go a long way in enabling communities to sustain themselves and provide livelihood to artisans.”
In the first phase, Project Reweave supported Telangana and Andhra (Ikat, Gadwal, Gollabama, Mahadevpur, Narayanpet, Bobilli and Prondhur) weaver community of 50 + looms with infrastructure capital support, trained 350 plus weavers in Pochampally district in basic digital skills. The project targets to reach the entire weaving community across the state over the next year.
Speaking about the initiative, Anil Bhansali, Managing Director, Microsoft India (R&D) said, “As part of our Citizenship initiative in India, Microsoft is focused on reviving various handloom forms in India’s textile heritage. The two new Digital Empowerment Centers for the weavers and artisans is part of this endeavor, it ties into Microsoft’s mission to empower every person and every organization in the communities we work in, by using our Azure based technology solutions and expertise to democratize opportunities and bridge the digital divide.”

How Telangana is using technology to transform its economy
Wed, 30 Mar 2016 13:36:26 +0000
http://www.it.telangana.gov.in/?p=2992
The state of Telangana, the country’s newest and 10th largest, emerged from its bifurcation with erstwhile Andhra Pradesh with a challenge: one of deep economic divide and low growth.
The state of Telangana, the country’s newest and 10th largest, emerged from its bifurcation with erstwhile Andhra Pradesh with a challenge: one of deep economic divide and low growth — the reasons why the division took place in the first place. But the TRS government has pulled out all stops in order to boost growth, using technology as a key enabler to improve productivity, transparency and ease of doing business, says a report by brokerage firm Religare.
Economists from the firm recently undertook a three-day road trip to the state (visiting districts Hyderabad, Nizamabad and Zaheerabad) meeting companies, dealers, farmers and government officials. The takeaways: consumption is strong, the government has a strong industrial policy in place, and technology is playing a big role in the state’s transformation.
“The slowdown that one has seen [in broader rural India] hasn’t played out as much for Telangana. The state effected a 43 percent hike for government employees. This helped boost consumption,” Religare Institutional Research Chief India Economist Jay Shankar told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.
He said that Hyderabad’s rise as a technology and business hub has helped policymakers frame pro-investment rules.
“This will go a long way in industrialising other districts of Telangana,” he said.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Jay Shankar’s interview with Sonia Shenoy & Reema Tendulkar on CNBC-TV
18.
Reema: Could you walk us through what your key takeaways are from the three day road trip to Telangana?
A:
Latha: Salary hikes in what. Was it private sector, public sector?
Latha: When the two states were bifurcated, the big fear was that Telangana is the poorer cousin which us why they were asking for bifurcation and the investments in Telangana had come from Andhra Pradesh guys. Is there any fear that Andhra Pradesh will deindustrialise Hyderabad or Telangana?
Reema: That is really good to hear the kind of role technology as well as the pick up that we have seen in business, the ease of doing business in Telangana but when you speak to your colleagues in the team which is the best way to play this Telangana consumer demand story in terms of sectors as well as stocks?
I do acknowledge that the selection of the district as well as the meetings may not be as randomised as you would want to; well it is not a survey but we just go and meet people randomly. Not that randomly as one would want to. However, the kind of feedback we got from other dealers as well, for example the cement demand; cement demand has picked up significantly; demand for pipes also, so we met the Finolex people, the distributor over there. Cement demands especially from institution; the institutional part of the demand has picked big time versus the retail demand.
Latha: I have two questions. One, the real estate space in Hyderabad, it was at one point in time the haven for real estate guys and thereafter prices plateaued even dropped. Has that market improved? Could you see those signs and separately cement a lot of cement demand was expected from both the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Did you notice those strengths?
Both the users as well as the dealers of, for example the TMT iron rod and also cement. There is a lot of demand which is now picking up especially from the builder community. So, the prices have not really started picking up that dramatically but there is a sense of pickup in demand and hence the prices, what they were expecting in the next 12 months is to increase by 10-15 percent over the next 12-14 months.
Latha: You have done a lot of rural state trips. What is the sense you are getting, after two poor monsoons, is rural demand showing extremely weak signs, at least in Telangana you seem to be giving us a sense that demand is very robust.
Among the crops also, there is a lower weightage of food grain crops where you have the impact of procurement prices being announced and hence the prices are not freely market determined, if you like, but if you look at prices for turmeric; the turmeric mandi that we visited, the prices have shot up from Rs 6,000 per quintal to Rs 8,000 per quintal and hence the price realisation by the farmers is much higher and that in some sense cushions the lower output if you like.
On top of that, as one of the finding that we have is the role of technology itself. So, for example, the mandi that we went to in Nizamabad, there we could see that there is an online market. You cannot sell offline turmeric, offline in the sense that face to face. So, you have to put your supply, so, farmers come to the mandi, they get it weighed by government appointed person and then that gets uploaded on the portal and if you are a licensed user then you can bid for that from anywhere in the world. So, that leads to better price realisation and price discovery. Hence, I would believe that they would be getting some better pricing vis-à-vis the earlier regime.

Sixty Mee Seva centres to dispense cash
Mon, 30 Jul 2018 10:42:35 +0000

Sixty Mee Seva centres to dispense cash from today Pilot project to go on stream in four districts
Mee Seva centres in the State will now become cash withdrawal centres, besides continuing to provide other services that are provided online now, if the initiative of the IT department takes a concrete shape.
The Government is set to introduce the first-of-its-kind Aadhaar-enabled Payment System in Mee Seva centres from Monday.
The AePS has been conceptualised to allow citizens to use Aadhaar as identity to access their bank accounts and withdraw cash through secure authentication through biometrics at Mee Seva centres.
All that the users will have to give is their Aadhaar number, bank name, account number and citizen biometric authentication to withdraw cash from their Aadhaar-linked bank accounts. The service is being rolled out in 60 Mee Seva centres — 15 each in Nizamabad, Karimnagar, Khammam and Mahabubnagar — and will be extended to cover all the 4,500-plus centres in due course.
Cash limit during the pilot project is being restricted to ₹2,000 and would be extended to Rs.10,000 in the coming days and the entire operation comes free of charge.
Agreement
An agreement to this effect has been reached between the Electronic Service Delivery (ESD) wing of the Information Technology department, the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) and Kotak Mahindra Bank.
The NCPI has, accordingly, integrated the Mee Seva centres in its payment gateway while the Kotak Mahindra Bank would provide the AePS solutions at the Mee Seva centres, allowing people to withdraw cash from them.
The ESD is currently serving over 1.5 lakh people, providing close to 600 services of 38 departments through a network of more than 4,500 Mee Seva centres on a daily basis.
The AePS service, according to senior officials, has been contemplated for the convenience of consumers in the rural areas where the number of bank branches and ATMs is relatively less. The service is expected to provide banking services in the close vicinity of citizens, saving time and avoiding transport-related expenses to users.

Mutual tie-up proves boon for both Telangana government and start-ups
Sun, 17 Jun 2018 05:33:10 +0000
http://it.telangana.gov.in/?p=5881
More than 14 start-ups are working with various departments in Telangana government.
Top priority of start-ups is more and quick revenue but if the government turns in as the customer, the dynamics change drastically. It is hard to get the government as a client but this is the best option ever as it gives a huge access to market. Working with the government depends on the business model of the startup because margins vary from time to time and from customer to customer.
With frugal innovations being limited to start-ups, Telangana Government is bridging this gap of technological advancements by betting on these dark horses for technologies, including Block Chain, Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Deep Analytics, among others. More than 14 start-ups are working with the government, not only with IT Department but various other departments such as Transport, Health, Tourism and Industries.
While youngsters may find it bureaucratic and time intensive to work with the government, the perks it has to offer is by far large. “A start-up could have ignored working with the government three to five years ago because they were not buying them much. If a person gets a breakthrough in any government project, the market access is outsised. The private sector cannot give such large volumes,” said B.V.R. Mohan Reddy, founder and executive chairman of Cyient and founding director of T-Hub.
To facilitate taking services from start-ups on cutting edge technology, the State Innovation Policy bypasses some rules such as track record which are followed in the conventional process of taking services from private agencies.
Dileep Konatham, Director of Digital Media, Telangana Government said, “To encourage start-ups, as per the State Innovation Policy, the government is bilaterally procuring products of relevance, bypassing the existing rules for procurement.”
Entrepreneurs pointed out that with faster implementation of technology, the start-up wave could be sustained. Furthermore, there are differences as working with bureaucrats is different compared to working with private players, especially in terms of functioning and research-level that is required.
“Getting access to government bodies has really become very amenable, especially after the startup wave has begun in India. What will help these start-ups is making the implementation as agile as the start-ups themselves with some checks and balances. When the government can implement them faster to check how it will work, that will be a real encouragement to the start-ups and the ecosystem as a whole,” Pavan Adipuram, who developed T-Chits, block chain solution for chit fund companies, said.
Minister K.T. Rama Rao had previously pointed out that it becomes expensive when a work is given to an established company but giving it to a start-up is a win-win situation. However, slow payments by the government create a trouble for start-ups after the project is delivered.
A founder of a start-up, on conditions of anonymity said, “Start-ups tend to face difficulty in raising funds for government projects. They cannot afford to invest own money as most of them are in a growing stage.”
Apart from money, continuous changes to the scope of the project, entrepreneurs believe in private companies. They have more freedom and can take over the product. But with the government, you have strict rules and regulations. The whole effort is more in government when compared to private companies.
“The scope of the project keeps changing which is called scope creep. Everything cannot be defined at the initial stage. Bureaucrats should understand the changes and pay accordingly, instead of rephrasing the words. Additionally, there are problems of payment, while everything gets done, payment doesn’t come on time,” Reddy said.

Telangana promoting innovation in Tier 2, 3 cities too: KT Rama Rao
Mon, 11 Jun 2018 06:36:46 +0000
http://it.telangana.gov.in/?p=5867
Telangana, the start-up state, offers a sea of opportunities to entrepreneurs and it does not want innovation and entrepreneurship to be confined to the capital city but spread to other major cities and towns.
Speaking at a seminar on ‘40 under 40: South India’s most vibrant young entrepreneurs’, conducted by The New Indian Express on Saturday, Minister for IT, industries, municipal administration and urban development KT Rama Rao said, “We don’t want innovation to be confined to Hyderabad and are taking up programmes in a sandbox approach to promote innovation in Tier-II and Tier-III cities. The young rural people have more pain points and can think out of box more than the city-bred youth. The order of the day is social innovation and rural innovation. Telangana government is supporting social and rural innovators.”
The state government has planned IT hubs at Nizamabad, Khammam, Karimnagar and Warangal by investing `25 crore on each to spur IT-based economy in districts. It is apart from mixed IT and industrial parks planned in Mahbubnagar and Nalgonda districts.
“It is known that 90 to 95 pc of the startups fail and do not survive. But the remaining, which find success and, depending on where they are incorporated, they will create the next wave of employment. The world’s top companies and largest industries cannot cumulatively generate enough jobs. This was pointed out by former Cisco chairman John Chambers on his visit to Hyderabad for Global Entrepreneurship Summit last year, and also by established entrepreneurs and industrialists. The biggest challenge to any government or head of state is employment generation. One of the issues that dominated the Telangana movement was unemployment. The government can only fill a few hundred thousand jobs.”
About incubation space in Hyderabad, Rao said the city had the largest number of co-working spaces funded by Union government’s department of science and technology. The second phase of T-hub startup incubator of state, will be up and running in the next two years. The goal is to create at least 1 million square feet of incubation space in Hyderabad in three to four years and that would be purely in government sector, he pointed out.
To a question whether he finds it difficult to handle his Twitter account, the minister said, “Can somebody in this room help? I have a problem in filtering out hundreds of comments/tweets I get everyday, some of which are also very abusive. The problem is with picking, identifying, prioritising and coming out with response to questions that warrant immediate reply from a minister. “He was not left disappointed as a young entrepreneur rushed in from the crowd to offer help, following which he directed her to Dileep Konatham, director, digital media, IT E&C department.

What happens when a room full of start-ups meets a minister who loves talking about start-ups, technology that drive industries and calls his state a ‘start-up state’ having a government which thinks like a start-up? You get The New Indian Express’ edex 40 Under 40 Start-up Awards, which had Minister K T Rama Rao in full swing. Questions of all sorts – inquisitive, critical, probing and even downright quirky were thrown at IT, Industries, Municipal and Urban Development Minister KT Rama Rao who conducted a town hall as the centerpiece of the entrepreneurship summit, for which the minister was chief guest.
When a young entrepreneur from Hyderabad, whose start-up has developed an air conditioned helmet asked the minister as to what kind of support the government plans to provide entrepreneurs looking to move out of incubators and scale up, Rao was quick in answering as he spelt out a new programme called ‘Pink book’, a “yellow pages for start-ups”. Rao said that the Pink book will be a comprehensive list of manufacturers working in various industrial sectors, a sort of a directory, which can be referred to by any Indian or a foreign company looking to collaborate and manufacture in the state.
A woman entrepreneur from Vanasthalipuram present in the audience, who did not pose a question heaped praises on the Telangana government for making the city safe for women even at night, especially traveling through Hyderabad Metro Rail, Rao thanked her and announced that metro rail from LB Nagar will be inaugurated next month.
TNIE Editor GS Vasu felicitated KTR on the occasion.
“She suggested that I pour out what I have in my head in the form of a story. So I sat down and wrote all my theories, except this time I did it as a story” he said. “So what were those lessons? One of them included patience where he mentioned that “everyone is lucky but to get that ‘bloody good luck’, one needs to wait for the right time.’ According to Sanghi, planning and persistence are something that will keep one going in the long run. The event was sponsored by MEIL, Telangana Tourism, ICFAI Group and supported by T-Hub, Prayaana, Startup Byte and Notion Press.

Telangana pushes the pedal on IT growth
Wed, 06 Jun 2018 05:59:22 +0000
http://it.telangana.gov.in/?p=5861
Telangana’s government has set itself a target of crossing Rs. 1,20,000 crore in IT exports by 2020
Hyderabad will also host the first edition of the International Blockchain Congress in August this year, in partnership with the NITI Aayog
India’s youngest state is all set to oust Bengaluru as the Silicon Valley of India, and if it’s FY18 annual report for the information technology sector were any indicator, then Hyderabad and the state of Telangana are on the right track.
The IT sector in Telangana grew by 9.32% in FY18, thanks to a robust investment by the industry. Exports reached a record Rs. 94,322 crore for the year, while over 43,000 jobs were added directly by IT firms at a time when pink slips have been the industry norm.
Telangana’s government has set itself a target of crossing Rs. 1,20,000 crore in IT exports by 2020, and also ensuring direct employment opportunities for at least four hundred thousand people within the same time frame.
Industry and IT minister for Telangana, KT Rama Rao, seems to be fairly confident of achieving this ambitious target, despite the state entering an election year.
“I thank all global and local IT companies for believing in Telangana. You have helped us in a big way by providing a positive buzz and participatory model where we, the government, could come in and reach out to your partners and your vendors to clock record growth,” he said.
Indian giants like Tech Mahindra, Infosys, Cyient, HCL Tech are not just looking at Hyderabad for its campuses.
Tech Mahindra and Cyient have already begun setting up of facilities in Warangal, while Infosys is currently evaluating prospects for the same and has also committed to double the headcount in its Pocharam campus in Hyderabad to 40,000 employees soon.
The state will be setting up Tech Parks in smaller cities of Nizamabad, Karimnagar and Khammam in coming years.
It’s not just Indian companies that have bet big on Hyderabad, players like Adobe, Apple, Amazon, Uber and Microsoft are looking to expand their operations here.
After successfully hosting GES (Global Entrepreneurship Summit) and the World IT Congress in Hyderabad last year, KT Rama Rao is convinced this has been made possible by a strong and stable policy environment.
“TS-iPass, T-hub, T-wallet, T-fibre and other innovative reforms by the department to ensure ease of doing business is bearing fruit in the state,” Rao added.
Hyderabad will also host the first edition of the International Blockchain Congress in August this year, in partnership with the NITI Aayog.

IT giant Infosys to upscale its workforce from 20K to 40K at Hyd
Fri, 01 Jun 2018 10:56:03 +0000
http://it.telangana.gov.in/?p=5849
At a time when fear of retrenchment hangs fire over techies across the country, IT giant Infosys will upscale its workforce from present 20,000 to 40,000 employees at Hyderabad’s Pocharam campus. This was announced by Telangana minister for IT, KT Rama Rao, on Friday.
Speaking to media, Infosys corporate communication official confirmed the company’s plans to increase workforce as quoted by the minister and said that Phase-II of its workspace is coming up in the Pocharam campus which will accommodate 20,000 employees. However, the official declined to comment when asked about a deadline.
The minister was speaking at an event organized by Infosys to observe World Environment Day at its Pocharam campus.
He also requested Chief Operating Officer(COO) of Infosys, Praveen Rao, who was present at the event, to develop another campus at Warangal. Rama Rao informed that two other IT companies, Tech Mahindra and Cyient are also setting up their campus in Warangal, which has 16 engineering colleges and a National Institute of Technology. Rama Rao said that Hyderabad-Warangal is an important industrial corridor and Warangal is shaping up, like how Mysuru is to Bengaluru.
To this, the Infosys COO said that the company will definitely take a look at it and establish a campus, as long as an ecosystem is in place for it. He added that Infosys is interested in setting up its campuses in Tier-II cities, which will also help in cutting down migration to larger cities.
Speaking on complaints regarding lack of proper road between entrance of the Pocharam SEZ where Infosys is located to its campus, Rama Rao, promised that money from HMDA will be utilized to improve the road. He also informed Infosys employees present at the event that commute time taken to their office from Uppal will shorten once the Uppal to Narapally skyway, at a cost of about Rs 1,400 crore is completed in the next 1.5 years and that MMTS service connecting Hyderabad to Yadadri will be passing close to the Infosys campus.
The minister added that more than 40 percent of the workforce working in IT companies in the country are people from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and they would like to work in Hyderabad if the company increases its workforce in Hyderabad.

Hyderabad’s IMAGE Tower to be India’s largest animation industry: KTR
Tue, 08 May 2018 04:21:45 +0000
http://it.telangana.gov.in/?p=5810
The IMAGE Tower (Innovation in Multimedia, Animation, Gaming & Entertainment) is all set to make Hyderabad the preferred destination for animation, visual effects, gaming and comics industry.
“IMAGE Tower is going to be the country’s largest such facility in terms of size with 1.6 million sqft and I hope it would be able to come out with our own DreamWorks Animation and Disney”, said Minister for Information Technology K T Rama Rao.
Speaking at the 10th year celebrations of Chhota Bheem, an Indian animated television series here on Monday, Rao said that there are many studios across the globe but what would be a truly redefining moment for Indian animation industry is when someone like Rajiv Chilaka builds India’s own DreamWorks Animation and Disney.
“Coming up with not just one character, or not one entity, or not just one series, but truly coming out with a product or studio which can literally take huge animation industry across the world and that is when we truly make a mark in animation industry and Rajiv Chilaka has the ability to do it”, he said.
Talking about Chhota Bheem, he said that his children are fans of this series and even he is well aware of all the characters in it and Kalia is his favourite. “Makers are not only able to capture the imagination of children but have come out with a character which lets parents leave their kids in comfort while watching it”.
Having debuted in 2008 on kids entertainment channel Pogo, Chhota Bheem celebrated one decade in television.
Rajiv Chilaka said it took five years to make the idea work. It became a game changer in Indian animation industry, he said, while adding that it began as a small step and went on to become 16,000 plus minutes content.

Hyderabad pips Bengaluru to become top IT talent retainer: Belong study
Fri, 04 May 2018 06:30:57 +0000
http://it.telangana.gov.in/?p=5806
In the backdrop of global tech giants setting up research centres, Hyderabad maintaining its top status on the ease of doing business (EoDB) index and a general wave of business optimism surrounding the city, the latest Belong report has found that the city trumps Bengaluru when it comes to employee retention.
Belong carried a head-on-head comparison between Hyderabad and Bengaluru for employee retention and found that companies in Hyderabad see 40-60 percent less employee attrition compared to Bengaluru.
For the purpose of this study, Belong analysed last two years data of large size IT companies such as IBM, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Wells Fargo, Infosys, Amazon, Microsoft, among others. When compared to the national average, Hyderabad again fared better with 30 percent-60 percent lesser attrition rate.
“Hyderabad enjoys being one of the world’s fastest growing tech cities. Access to rich talent pool, affordable and reliable infrastructure, and a pro-business government outlook collectively make it an irresistible investment destination for both tech startups and giants alike. If people comprise 60-65 percent of a tech company’s operation cost, attracting best engineers to do the job becomes as important as the ability to retain them for longer tenures. And Hyderabad seems to be scoring well on this front by having lower attrition compared to other Indian cities,” says Phani Pattamatta, executive director of TiE Hyderabad.
Belong also compared the average salaries of employees in Hyderabad and Bengaluru for emerging skills. It found that the average salaries for hard-to-hire roles like Data Scientists and UI/UX Designers was 10-20 percent lesser in Hyderabad compared to Bengaluru.
In the last few years, factors such as lower cost of living, ease of doing business, cheaper real estate, better roads and infrastructure, and lesser traffic compared to other the metros have attracted the who’s who of the tech giants to set up their offices in Hyderabad. This includes Google, Amazon, Uber and Facebook to name a few.
Belong said in a statement, “And in the wake of Telangana’s formation in 2014 and KT Rama Rao taking over as the IT Minister, Hyderabad has been making the right noises when it comes to the IT ecosystem. It’s also home to India’s largest incubation centre – T-Hub.”
“For many years now we have always heard that Hyderabad is touted to be India’s next Silicon Valley. But now for the first time we have data to prove that it is a more viable option for tech companies because of higher retention and comparatively lower salaries owing to lower cost of living,” said Rishabh Kaul, co-founder, Belong.

Mee Seva
ESD currently provides for delivery of 550+ services of 40+ departments to 35+ Mn population through multiple channels. These channels include:
MeeSeva centres: 4500+ Kiosks spread across Telangana State
MeeSeva portal: A web portal for availing citizen services
Mobile App: Expected to be launched in August 2017
As part of service delivery, ESD captures multiple aspects of citizens’ transaction such as transaction amounts, location/channel of transaction initiation, time-stamps pertaining to multiple stages of application processing, etc and also the service completion times from the department. However existing system does not allow quick and intuitive analysis of performance of the Franchisees as well as by the departments each time requiring queries to be written and separate reports in tabular form.
ESD has developed an interactive dashboard called, “Interactive MeeSeva Dashboard” also referred as “MeeSeva Dashboard” is a powerful tool to drive actions towards achieving several aspects of improved service delivery.
These include:
Near real-time Monitoring the SLAs for efficient delivery of services to citizens
Near real time monitoring of the service delivery by the Franchisees
Near real time monitoring of performance Districts wise/department wise/service wise etc
Interactive MeeSeva Dashboard provides real-time statistics and analysis of citizen transactions undertaken through MeeSeva channels and provide insights to drive targeted actions to address the issues pertaining to delivery of services at any point in time. MeeSeva Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the performance of ESD setup through carefully chosen metrics. It allows comparison of current status with performance in previous time periods and help identify the root causes of sub-par performance. The accurate identification of root causes along with continuous monitoring from senior ITE&C officials drive the actions by departments and officials to resolve the issues in time bound manner.
2. Functional solution implemented
The project was conceptualized to translate the focus on improving the service delivery into action. MeeSeva Dashboard relies on following approach to empower ESD and GoT departments to ensure quality of services delivered to citizens meet the standards outlined in the Government charter.
Transaction information which includes details about the transaction such as where and when the transaction has been carried out, which department is the transaction part of, what are the charges being collected for the transactions, details about the center where the transaction has been done along with the operator who has carried out the transaction.
SLA details about each of the transaction which includes the number of transaction that have breached SLA, officer/service/department with highest number of breaches in the past one week/month/quarter.
Growth analysis using which officials can understand the trends of transaction under each service, trends in the same department across the districts, trends in the same district across the departments which helps in identifying the best practices that are being followed and can be replicated in the corresponding counterparts.
MeeSeva Dashboard provides a holistic view of the above-mentioned analysis and provides key metrics which can be used to perform a combination of two or more analysis using multiple decision points, applications.
3. Pre-deployment scenario with the post-deployment benefits
Prior to the deployment of the MeeSeva Dashboard, ESD use to obtain the information on service/department/district wise statistics of transaction count and SLA status from individual portals of various platforms that ESD manages i.e. MeeSeva service and ESeva services. The process of obtaining the data and analyzing same to bring out insights involved repeated efforts of ESD staff every time data is required to be analyzed. The limited automation made multiple analysis a time-consuming exercise. The time aspect resulted in delayed actions by ESD and departments which impacted the overall service delivery.
Since the deployment of the MeeSeva Dashboard, the time required to know the current status of the transactions and performance of the departments has reduced significantly and is on a near real time basis. ESD has now gained a near real-time view of the performance of entire ESD setup which has been quantified using metrics. These metrics help ESD quickly identify the issues with services/departments/MeeSeva centres and drive actions to concerned authorities. The SLA adherence has been the biggest beneficiary of the MeeSeva Dashboard implementation which has led to a significant improvement in the quality of delivery of citizen services.
4. Quantitative impact of the initiative
ESD has been able to plug the gaps that were emerging in the monitoring and governance framework through implementation of the MeeSeva Dashboard. The MeeSeva Dashboard has resulted in improvement in following aspects of service delivery:
Adherence to service-specific SLAs by participating departments has enhanced.
ESD has been able to better monitor the performance of MeeSeva centres, identify the issues using key metrics and quickly formulate the corrective actions required.
Issues prevailing at department levels have been identified using the insights emerging from the MeeSeva Dashboard. ESD has been able to drive actions through departments to achieve permanent solutions that were hampering the service delivery.
The access to MeeSeva Dashboard has been shared with government departments whose services are provided through MeeSeva. This will assist them in easily monitoring the performance of key officials who are responsible for delivery of citizen services.
District managers of ESD are also provided with the access to MeeSeva Dashboard for them to have real time access to the performance of the MeeSeva centres.
5. Awards
Telangana gets CSI Nihilent e-Governance Award of Excellence 2016
Mr. GT Venkateshwar Rao, Commissioner, ESD, received CSI Nihilent e-Governance Award of Excellence 2016 for the state of Telangana at Coimbatore on 24 January, 2017.
KM-ATOM File Management System
The revolution of KM-ATOM is fast spreading in all the departments and district collectorates of the state showing the way for others too. The use of KM-ATOM has helped in reducing red-tapism and helped officials to do their job more effectively. It also provides powerful MIS for improving accountability in office environment.

Telangana ahead in digital race
By PS Dileep
Blazing a new trail, the young State of Telangana is gearing up to test its optical fibre network in four villages of Maheshwaram mandal in Ranga Reddy district from next month. Once it succeeds, the State government would be able to connect nearly 3.6 crore people in one crore households to the world using high speed Internet connectivity in less than a year.
The State government’s prestigious Telangana Fibre Grid project is racing ahead of other States in the country to establish the optical fibre network and even set new benchmarks in providing Internet connectivity to every household in the State. As against 1.25 lakh km of optic fibre ducts, more than 27,000 km of optic fibre duct has already been laid. The government is keen to use IT for effective governance and also ensure inclusive social and economic development.
Fibre cables being laid
“Our team is working extensively in collaboration with officials of Mission Bhagiratha to complete laying of optic fibre cable ducts as per fixed schedule. To take up a pilot project, our Technology Demonstration Network (TDN) is being installed to provide high speed internet connectivity to these four villages in Maheshwaram mandal next month,” Telangana Fibre Grid Corporation (T-Fibre) Managing Director Sujai Karampuri told Telangana Today.

City to catch the eye of the world yet again
The Telangana government and the Nasscom are in discussion for establishing a Centre of Excellence on Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences in the State.
The facility would create awareness on the emerging technologies, help start-ups and map capabilities in the areas as well as prescribe standards in their use. “We are in discussion with the State,” Nasscom president R. Chandrashekhar said, adding that the CoE would be in tune with the State government’s focus on AI and data sciences.
Along with Telangana IT and Industries Minister K.T. Rama Rao, he was addressing the media on the upcoming World Congress on Information Technology and Nasscom India Leadership Forum-2018.
Nasscom, with which the Karnataka government had set up such a CoE in Bengaluru, proposes to have a few such facilities to aid in absorption of the technologies in different domains such as financial sector, healthcare, agriculture and manufacturing across the country. The CoE would build a repository of capabilities in the field.
“This is like Olympics of IT,” he said describing the WCIT to be held in India for the first time. The leadership forum is also being held in Hyderabad for the first time. The three-day event begins on February 19. Nasscom has invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to inaugurate. Mr. Rama Rao said thought leaders and those from the industry and government would be participating in the event comprising 22 power-packed sessions and 24 different forums. For Hyderabad, the WCIT comes close on the heels of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit that it hosted.
“Hyderabad will get visibility across the world once more,” the Minister said. Major announcements could be expected from the State government in the context of its discussions with Nasscom and the focus being on AI, robotics and cybersecurity, he said.
Discussions on AI, blockchain, experience age, innovation, future of work, sports and technology, policy dialogues, new tech deep dives, CIO sessions and boardroom CEO sessions would form part of the event.

Rousing start to Global Entrepreneurship Summit
By Dennis Marcus Mathew
Dazzling laser projections and rousing music along with inspiring speeches from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Ivanka Trump saw the eighth edition of Global Entrepreneurship Summit getting off to an energetic start here on Tuesday.
The event, one of the largest gatherings of entrepreneurs in the world, saw Modi and Ivanka reaching the mammoth dais at the Hyderabad International Convention Centre to a loud applause.
A standing audience welcomed the two, who were flanked by Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao and Governor ESL Narasimhan apart from Union Ministers Sushma Swaraj and Nirmala Sitharaman.
Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao set the momentum for continuing rounds of applause as he took the stage for the welcome speech. Welcoming the delegates to experience Hyderabad’s ‘legendary hospitality’ and to relish its signature dish, the Hyderabadi Biryani, KCR also won applause as he pointed out how the TS government’s industrial project approval system of TS-iPass had ‘worked admirably’ on the ground. The policy had helped setting up of 5,469 industrial units, investment worth $17.5 billion and 4,00,000 jobs, he said.
The audience had more to applaud as Ivanka took the stage, especially as she said Modi was a symbol of transformation himself, and how he was building India as a symbol of hope to the world. “The people of India inspire us all,” she said, and garnered more applause when she repeated what President Trump said earlier this year, that India ‘had a true friend in the White House’.
Later, talking on women entrepreneurs, Ivanka drew more cheering and whistling when she pointed out that all too often, women had to do more than men to prove themselves at work.
The biggest round of applause, cheering and whistles however appeared to have been reserved for Modi, whose mentions of contributions from women scientists to the Mars Orbiter Mission, Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams, and of loans to women entrepreneurs had the delegates, especially women delegates, clapping all the way.
The event had a unique start as well, with Mitra the Robot coming on stage and Modi, along with Ivanka, pressing a button on the robot to signal the start of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, which is being held in South Asia for the first time.

Ideas can transform India: KT Rama Rao
The Minister said that startups and innovators need to look at innovations that are in synch with the reality.
With about 50 percent of our population being below the age of 27, India is heading towards becoming a young county. And this will truly unleash the innovation potential, said KT Rama Rao, Telangana IT Minister. He was speaking at the Road to GES conference organised by INK, T-Hub and Telangana government.
The Minister said that startups and innovators need to look at innovations that are in synch with the reality. They need to develop solutions that can be useful to develop India. “Not only startups, I feel even government and governance need to innovate and it is important to be in sync with the reality,” Rama Rao said.
Taking cue from eminent Indian scientist R A Mashelkar, Rama Rao informed that India needs to pole vault if it aims to join the league of the first world countries in the next few years. He spoke about how 1 billion phones are there in India and how it can transform the way we use technology for the betterment of society.
“India needs adventure capitalist and not venture capital. We need people who can invest in local solutions in India and not concentrate on solutions that are the me-too kind,” he said.
Speaking about how Telangana has been able to understand the pain points of common man and has used technology to reduce them, he spoke to RTA m-wallet and TS i-PASS. These, according to him, have redefined how we do business in Telangana.

Telangana partners with NASSCOM to setup Centre of Excellence
The Government of Telangana signed an MoU with the National Association of Software & Services Companies (NASSCOM) to establish a Centre of Excellence for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (CoE – DS & AI) in the State, on the sidelines of NASSCOM India Leadership Forum being held in the city. To be established on a public-private partnership model, the CoE is the most recent addition to NASSCOM’s ‘hub-and-spoke’ network of CoEs across major locations in the country, aimed at evangelizing new and emerging technologies. With an initial joint investment of Rs. 40 Crore, the CoE will catalyze the growth of the deep tech ecosystem in Telangana, by providing the stimulus for innovation and in-depth research in the areas of data science and artificial intelligence.
Leveraging its partner and member ecosystem, NASSCOM will work to enable industry-oriented research, augment citizen-centric solutions, promote data-driven decision making, enhance academic capacities, and support appropriate skills building and talent development through the CoE. The CoE will serve as a platform for intelligence-sharing and technology collaboration between stakeholders, to build collective capabilities for the industry and country in the cutting-edge areas of data science and artificial intelligence. It will provide high-end technology, field expertise, and curated programs to augment capabilities across academia, enterprises, government, innovators and advanced start-ups.
Speaking on the occasion, Sri KT Rama Rao, Hon’ble Minister for IT, Industries, MA & UD, NRI Affairs said, “Hyderabad is emerging as an attractive location to global technology companies. State government had introduced special IT Policy and taken up T-Hub for encouraging start-ups. The first phase of the T-Hub had already earned the reputation of being the largest incubator in the country. Government of Telangana realizes the opportunities the newer technologies present and laid the foundation of a Data Analytics Park to tap the innovation and employment opportunities in this rising sector. Telangana will be the first State in India to bring Artificial Intelligence in Public Health Screening and we are excited about how technology has the potential to make great social impact. The Government is keen to create a robust Data Science & Artificial Intelligence ecosystem for the various stakeholders to thrive, by providing support, mentorship, and other capabilities. This Centre of Excellence, in partnership with NASSCOM and the industry, is in the direction for developing Telangana and India as global hub for DS & AI in the coming years.”
Sharing his thoughts, Mr. R Chandrashekhar, President, NASSCOM, said “India is now on its next growth curve, led by disruptive technologies like data sciences and AI. The vision behind this CoE is to consolidate and streamline efforts in this space by building state-of-the-art infrastructure to amplify the impact that India can indigenously create. With the opportunities that digital technologies present, this CoE-DS and AI is strategically placed to provide data-backed solutions to critical and complex problems across the country and globe.”
Data science and artificial intelligence technologies allow harnessing complex, high volume, high speed data into insights for decision making, emerging as the one of biggest growth opportunities for India to capitalize on. In recent times, artificial intelligence has emerged from the confines of scientific labs and found various uses to impact everyday life. It has found applications across industries – financial services, automotive, healthcare, and retail, to name a few. It is expected that the data science and artificial intelligence industry in India (IT and non-IT industries) will be worth US $16 billion by 2025, and is likely to spur an additional employment of 1,50,000 professionals in the country.

“We have broaders policy on ICT and also 10 sectoral policies. This has led us to become the most business-friendly State in India. With this background, I welcome big companies to come and invest in Telangana,” he said.

Press Release
Mobile apps take governance to the people in Telangana
By Sunny Baski
With almost everyone using a smartphone, making payments, airing grievances, lodging police complaints and even keeping an eye on the traffic is now an easy task in the country’s youngest State.
From the Transport Department’s RTA mWallet, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation’s MyGHMC, and the Hawk Eye from the City Police are just some of the apps that have been steadily drawing huge response from the public.
The RTA mWallet was launched on March 30 last year for storing vehicle-related documents. The mobile app was a boon for those who worry about carrying physical copies or misplacing them. Motorists can now show the RTA mWallet on their mobiles during checking by police.
According to Rudra Teja, the developer of mWallet, the app has so far got nearly 20 lakh users and has gained a rating of 3.97 stars of 5 on Google Play store. “We have around 3,000 new users registering every day, thus making mWallet the most downloaded app in any State,” he said.
RTA officials too said there was a positive feedback for the app and that users were even giving suggestions like adding an option to include the pollution certificate as well. After the integration of e-challan with the mWallet, citizens had been coming forward to pay their fines which were pending for years and the app had led to collection of Rs 1 crore through challans, officials said.
Apps which help in ensuring safety, apart from enabling lodging of complaints, like the Hawk Eye of the Hyderabad City Police and the City Traffic Police’s Hyderabad Traffic Live too are getting immensely popular.
The Hawk Eye app, which has several features like woman’s safety while on travel, reporting crimes, a SOS button for accessing help in emergencies etc., has now been extended to nine Police Commissionerate limits in the State.
According to Hyderabad Police Commissioner VV Srinivas Rao, the app, which was being adopted by the police in other districts as well, the app had nearly 9 lakh users, with at least 70 complaints coming daily from Hyderabad Commissionerate alone.
On the other hand, the MyGHMC app launched on July 15 this year for payment of property tax, trade license fee, downloading of birth and death certificates for records digitally signed on the GHMC server, submission of civic-related grievances and so on, has nearly three lakh users.
Jayaraj Kennedy, Additional Commissioner, GHMC said the app was now the highest downloaded municipal corporation app in the country. “So far around 90,000 complaints have been received through the app, of which only 2,000 grievances are pending,” he said.
T Wallet, the digital wallet from the State government, launched on June 1, is currently the only State government app in the country available for making digital payments for both government and private services, officials said, adding that soon, Metro rail tickets would be integrated with the T Wallet for loading money into Metro smart cards.
M Sreenivasulu, Programme Head of T Wallet, said more than three lakh users have registered and generated transactions worth nearly Rs 75 crore over a span of six months. “All the 4,000 Mee Seva centres in the State were integrated with T Wallet and payments can be done for 500 services,” he added.
The Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL), is also receiving an overwhelming response to its app. It enables payment of electricity bills using credit card, debit card or net banking options. The app will also send a receipt to the registered email and on phone via SMS on the transaction.

Press Release
Ford and HMDA Signed MoU to explore Integrated Mobility Solutions
Ford and Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority Sign MoU to Explore Integrated Mobility Solutions for Smarter City Commute
Ford has signed a MoU to conduct a feasibility assessment to improve the commuter experience in Hyderabad using technology
The agreement aims to explore and evaluate an integrated mobility service solution across multiple modes of transport that could help ease congestion
Ford is engaging with several cities to pave the way for customized solutions and innovative collaborations to help make people’s lives better by changing the way the world moves
Ford and Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) today signed a Memorandum of Understanding to assess the feasibility of a common digital mobility solution for commuters in the city of Hyderabad.
Under the agreement, Ford will collaborate and work with the city authorities to analyze Hyderabad’s existing transportation system. Ford will then work with HMDA to design tech-based mobility solutions that improve the commuter experience, and that will optimize efficiency for transport operators, as well as reduce congestion.
Speaking after the MoU signing ceremony, MA&UD Minister KT Rama Rao said, “Hyderabad has a significant advantage due to its excellent infrastructure and connectivity. This MoU with Ford Motor Company would further it and make commute within the city more convenient for all. We look forward to working with Ford on this Mobility platform and multiple other fronts in the future.”
“As a mobility company, Ford is working with cities to help address growing transportation challenges,” said R. Mahadevan, Director, Ford Smart Mobility, India. “Partnering with local development authorities like HMDA and offering technology solutions fine-tuned to the needs of the cities means we can help find new ways to make commuters’ journeys seamless.”
While different modes of public transport such as light rail, metro and buses co-exist in Hyderabad, 800 vehicles are added to the city’s streets each day. Hyderabad’s smart and safe city project compliments Ford’s vision to provide innovative solutions to common mobility issues.
Collaborating with HMDA, Ford will engage with the relevant stakeholders and explore solutions in areas such as digital cashless one-time payments, mobile-based ticketing and smart card payments for passengers transiting through different modes of transport. Technology aided solutions can enable commuters to spend less time when switching between various modes of transport, improve predictability and thereby reduce gridlocks.
The study will also analyze how multiple modes of transport are used by Hyderabad residents every day, in an effort to identify areas of improvement.
Today, half the world’s population lives in cities. By 2030, that number is expected to grow to 60 percent. As city populations grow, the challenges tied to moving people and goods become tougher.
Ford is committed to helping improve the transport situation in Indian cities. Earlier this year, Ford started working with the cities of Indore and Mumbai to find customized mobility solutions. While in Mumbai, Ford is helping design an integrated mobility solution for multimodal transport, and in Indore Ford is working to support the city authorities in encouraging use of the public transit system and improving general road safety.

After Hyderabad now Mahabubnagar draws IT attention
It is not just Hyderabad, even tier-II cities in the State such as Mahabubnagar are attracting substantial investments in the IT sector, said IT and Industries Minister KT Rama Rao, on Thursday.
In a boost to the IT infrastructure in the State, the government is now planning to give administrative sanctions for construction of the Mahabubnagar IT Tower, said Rao.
The Minister, along with Mahabubnagar legislator Srinivas Goud, handed over approval certificates to 18 IT companies that had come forward to set up a unit in the area. The Minister said now top-notch companies were evincing interest to expand their business in tier-II cities of the State.
“Companies are coming forward to set up their units after the Telangana government announced its new IT Policy, which offers many benefits to entrepreneurs,” said Rao.
Goud explained that to attract more IT investment to the district, a delegation would visit the United States. Earlier there were visits from officials and legislators from Nizamabad, Warangal, and Karimnagar. With the huge IT investments coming to the district, unemployed youth would get opportunities, he said.

Hyderabad to turn into a hub for creatives
By B. Krishna Mohan
With the State Government making a beginning for an Innovation in Multimedia, Animation, Gaming and Entertainment (IMAGE) tower, which will be an one-stop shop for all things animation and allied fields, several existing players are enthused about the prospects that will open up.
City-based companies have already handling overseas assignments and their numbers are bound to increase, said industry exports. The new facility, which will have render centres among other infrastructure, will turn Hyderabad into a creative engineering hub, they said.
“Hyderabad’s will be the preferred destination for multimedia, animation, gaming and others. There will be a lot of common facilities at IMAGE that smaller companies can use on a pay-per-use basis. Since the ecosystem is present, new companies will be keen to set up their operations here,” said K Basi Reddy, chairman and chief executive officer at city-based Digiquest India, a digital post production facility that caters to film, advertisement, television, animation and gaming industries.
Set up in 2004, the company has so far invested about Rs 40 crore. It also offers multiple training modules. “We have plans to scale up, particularly our education programmes. That will see an investment of about Rs 100 crore in phases. Part of this can be in the IMAGE Tower as well, depending on the incentives,” he said.
Reddy, a veteran in the field who has worked on policy issues and advised on the project, said exports of multimedia, animation, gaming and entertainment from could double by 2020. “The exports, as per estimates available, could now be about Rs 800 crore,” he said adding that focus should be on addressing the skill gaps in the sector.
“IMAGE Tower has been a labour of love for everyone in the VFX community within Hyderabad,” said Pete Draper, division head and chief technical director, Makuta, which worked on multiple projects including Bahubali and Eega.
“We as a studio have advised on development and facilities for several years now. We are excited that this will give opportunities to new studies and creatives,” said Draper.
On investments, he said: “It all depends on if we qualify for a space. The aim is to get new studios up and running. That is what we are most interested in. We would look to use the facilities as best as we could. I think it would be more poignant for new creative to collaborate.”
L Maruti Sankar, managing director of 7 Seas Technologies, said: “The IMAGE tower is a first of its kind initiative for animation related fields by a government. A lot of global companies will seek to start operations here. We are in the process of expanding. We have started in Hyderabad and will be logical to expand here to get further benefits.” The company is now working on a few gaming products for this Christmas, he said.
“We will look to have about 30 seats. We guess IMAGE tower’s model will be on similar to T-Hub, were the occupants pay per seat. It will give us access to some key hardware, which will help in enhancing the output and reducing the time taken,” said Hemanth Satyanarayana, chief executive officer at Imaginate Software Labs, which works on artificial and virtual reality projects.

The government announced on Tuesday that it will be rolling out TWorks by end of 2018 and it will come up in 2,50,000 square feet area and have equipment’s worth $20 million.

So, in order to lead the narrative, our government is setting India’s largest and probably world’s second largest collaborative platform called TWorks. It will be a prototyping and design centre for individuals, entrepreneurs and students in the design and hardware space. I believe it could change the way we do business in India,” Rama Rao said.

CNC machines, cutting machines, wielding and carpentry tools, PCBs and assembly machines, 3D printers of all ranges will be available to build prototypes,” he informed.
The Minister also informed that TWorks could also be supported and partnered by India Design Centre (IDC). “The TWorks will be an essential hub in the wheel to herald a new wave of entrepreneurs, makers, doers, tinkers and designers of all kind. It will be a much desired platform to collaborate and foster the new growth engines of the industrial revolution,” he said.
Design drives growth
He also said that great countries have developed and equipped their schools, colleges, institutions and academics with great designers and have taught their population to indulge in design. He added further that India has a great opportunity for industrial revolution 4.0 and urged the country to lead this revolution and not be mere followers as happened in the last three industrial revolutions.

Telangana to use Microsoft AI for eye care screening for children
Government of Telangana adopts Microsoft Cloud and becomes the first state to use Artificial Intelligence for eye care screening for children.
Government of Telangana will use Microsoft cloud-based advanced analytics including Artificial Intelligence based eye care screening MINE as part of the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram program under the National Health Mission.
In its mission to drive health and well-being in the state, the Government of Telangana today announced an agreement with Microsoft India to adopt cloud-based analytics for Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram, its health care screening program for children. The state has also agreed to adopt Microsoft Intelligent Network for Eyecare (MINE), an AI platform to reduce avoidable blindness thereby becoming the first state in India to deploy artificial intelligence for eye care screening.
The Government of Telangana and Microsoft had signed an MoU in November 2016 to use Microsoft’s cloud technology to drive citizen services and digital inclusion. Under this MoU, Microsoft India conducted a cloud-based, advanced analytics pilot project to understand the health screening program among children from birth to eighteen years in 10 districts. The process involved health screenings of school students, carried out by mobile health teams under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK), under the National Health Mission. The pilot, using Microsoft’s advanced analytics helped the state government unlock actionable insights by highlighting major conditions affecting the health of children in the state. The pilot is now scaling to a full-fledged solution which will enable the Telangana health officials to gain valuable insights to tackle health conditions covered under the RBSK program in children across the state. One of the insights already derived indicated that vision impairment is one of the most prevalent health issues among children. The Government of Telangana has decided to adopt MINE to address this issue which will help them make early interventions and preventing or treating instances of refractive errors.
With a commitment to enhancing life impact through technology, Microsoft India, in collaboration with L. V. Prasad Eye Institute, launched MINE in December 2016. MINE is a global consortium of eye care providers, research and academic institutions joining hands to apply artificial intelligence to help in the elimination of avoidable blindness and scale delivery of eye care services worldwide. The consortium is working on diverse datasets of patients across geographies to come up with machine learning predictive models for vision impairment and eye diseases.
Speaking about the partnership, Sri K.T. Rama Rao, Minister of IT, Government of Telangana, said, “We are very pleased to announce that Telangana will be the first state in India to bring AI in Public Health Screening and we are excited about how technology has the potential to make a great social impact. I am extremely happy with the collaboration between our Health and IT Departments and Microsoft which has resulted in a solution that is going to make a huge difference to the lives of the people in our country, starting with our state. With the adoption of cloud-based advanced analytics, we see a huge potential for improving the healthcare of our young citizens. We are the first state to adopt MINE an AI based model to tackle avoidable blindness and we welcome Microsoft’s partnership in this endeavor. “
Commenting on this initiative Mr. Jayesh Ranjan, Principal Secretary, Information Technology, Government of Telangana, said, “This initiative in partnership with Microsoft can potentially touch up to 60 lakh children who will be screened for health conditions under the RBSK program. The Government of Telangana signed an MoU with Microsoft last year to identify areas of collaboration primarily in e-Governance, Health, Agriculture, Education, Skilling, as well as the modernization of State Data Centers. Multiple areas were taken up and subsequently, we decided to lead with health care first. It is heartening to see this association extend further into a scalable project involving the cloud platform and advanced analytics that will help build efficiencies of our health screening program. With the Artificial Intelligence platform MINE, we are hopeful that we can help detect and reduce avoidable blindness among children in our state.”
Speaking on the initiative Dr. G.N. Rao, Founder and Chair, L. V. Prasad Eye Institute and MINE Partner said, “I am delighted to hear of the large scale eye screening for children by the Govt. of Telangana and to employ the business intelligence and ML platforms of Microsoft for analytics. This is a welcome development and a good step for the provision of good quality eye care to children in future. My best wishes to the success of the programme.”
Speaking on the occasion, Anil Bhansali, Corporate Vice President, Cloud & Enterprise and Managing Director, Microsoft India (R & D) Pvt. Ltd., said, “We have been focused on accelerating digital transformation in India using our advanced machine learning and cloud technologies. We are pleased to strengthen our partnership with the Government of Telangana by bringing the combined power of data, cloud and advanced analytics to drive the state’s missions around healthcare and digital inclusion. “
Speaking on the occasion Sanjeev Gupta, General Manager, Public Sector, Microsoft Corporation India Pvt. Ltd, said, “At Microsoft, we are always striving to help India transform digitally and this partnership will go a long way in empowering citizens to leverage the power of the cloud. We are proud to partner with the government of Telangana and hope to work with them to redefine health care in India.”
Microsoft India will work with the Government of Telangana to leverage existing technologies and infrastructure for immediate interventions of vision impairment cases including refractive error, cataract, eye surgery outcomes and eyesight problems, as well as derive deeper insights around eye care.
Machine Learning is one of Microsoft’s key focus areas and one in which the company is making significant inroads, both by way of research and development breakthroughs as well as translating the outcome into real customer impact. Microsoft has engaged with L V Prasad Eye Institute to build a predictive model that helps predict regression rates for eye operations, enabling doctors to pinpoint the procedures needed to prevent and treat visual impairments. To boost the education ecosystem, Microsoft has been working with various state governments on a machine learning based model to analyze and predict school drop outs and take preventive action. To aid digital agriculture, Microsoft has partnered with ICRISAT to provide powerful cloud-based predictive analytics to empower farmers with crucial information and insights to help reduce crop failures and increase yield, in turn, reducing stress and generating better income.

TASK to tie-up with State Universities
In a move that would bring about change in the engineering education, the Telangana Academy for Skill and Knowledge (TASK) will soon tie up with the State universities like Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University to help students get internships in the industry.
The idea is to equip engineering students with industry related skills and help them in securing a job after graduating from the college.
Presently, the engineering students have to do a major project as part of their final semester. By collaborating with the universities, the TASK intends to have an internship for students in the final semester.
Students will be selected based on the written examination which will be followed by an interview. Candidates clearing both the rounds will be sent to the industry for internships.
“Internship gives real time exposure and helps students prepare for the industry when they graduate. The TASK focus will be on the students from the rural background,” says Sujiv Nair, CEO, TASK.
Already 34,502 students from 91 engineering colleges and over 700 from nine degree colleges in the State have registered with the Internshala through the TASK. Of the total, 83 students have got internships in the companies like Open text, Leap Robots, Vebbler, Aylin Global and Auto Next with a stipend ranging between Rs.3,000 per month to Rs.12,000 per month.
This apart, through direct tie-ups with companies like SAP, IBM, CISCO, Microsoft, Sale Force, Oracle, Auto Desk and Samsung, the TASK is not just training students in the industry related skills but also helping them get certification at a discounted price. Certification from companies like Oracle and Microsoft costs anywhere between Rs.10,000 to Rs.55,000 but through TASK students get it for less than Rs.5,500.
Training will be given to students in the specially designed curriculum which meets industry requirements and certification is done by the companies after successfully clearing the examination.
“Engineering students with certification from the companies will have the higher probability of getting job than students with without certification,” Sujiv explains.

TASK centres to be set up in Warangal, Nizamabad districts
The State government has decided to set up regional centres of Telangana Academy for Skill and Knowledge (TASK) in Warangal and Nizamabad districts.
Minister for Information and Technology, KT Rama Rao, during a meeting with principals of private engineering colleges, industry experts and TASK officials on Friday said that the exercise of setting up TASK regional centres will be completed at the earliest.
The Minister said that high-quality training will be imparted to engineering students in rural areas and urged the management of engineering and pharmacy colleges in the State to cooperate with TASK to train students.
The state government is taking stringent action against private engineering colleges which are not up to the standards, he said.
Large numbers of engineering students graduate every year but they lack communication skills which have become their biggest drawback and asked colleges to look into the issue. If one year internships are provided in private companies, a system that is practised in Germany, the employability of such engineering students will improve, he added.

Press Release
Two electronics parks in Telangana get Centre’s nod
The Ministry of Electronics and Information and Technology has given approval for two electronics manufacturing clusters called Electronics Park in Telangana. While the first one is all set to come up in e-city at Raviryal, 20 km from Shamshabad International Airport, the second one will come up in Maheshwaram Science Park at Maheshwaram.
The e-city park was approved by the Centre on July 31, the second park was approved on Friday, a senior official of the Telangana government told Telangana Today. Meanwhile, the additional secretary at MEITY Ajay Kumar tweeted Approval by GoI_MeitY for 310 acre Electronic Mfg Cluster by TSIICLtd in (Maheshwaram) Hyderabad. Project cost Rs 437 crore.
On July 31 he had also tweeted Approval by GoI_MeitY for 600 acre Electronic Mfg Cluster to be set up by TSIIC in (Raviryal) Hyderabad. Project cost Rs 667 crore.
Confirming the development, Telangana IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan told, “Ending today, the Centre has given final approval for setting up the electronics parks in the State which will be set up in an overall area of about 950 acres.” The total project cost will be about Rs 1,104 crore, which could be split between the State and the Centre.
Now the State plans to attract electronic companies to make an investment in the park and set up their units. It will serve both assembly as well as manufacturing units and will have common facilities that the companies can use.
A huge domestic market exists in conjunction with the right set of ingredients to create a thriving electronics manufacturing sector. The sector will not only attract manufacturers to the State and bring in more investments but also will provide jobs to thousands of skilled youth. Hyderabad today houses over 250 companies, both large and small which together employ over 50,000 professionals.
In its Electronics Policy unveiled last year, Telangana has set a goal of attracting investments to the tune of $3 billion in the electronics sector, create an employment of 1,60,000 and enhance production from approximately $1 billion to $7.5 billion by 2020.
Electronics manufacturing industry is one of the largest and fastest growing industries globally. The $1.75 trillion industry is expected to reach $2.4 trillion by 2020. The demand in the Indian market is expected to reach $400 billion by 2020, as per estimates.

The MoUs with NASSCOM Foundation and Waste Ventures India are broadly focused on providing support for implementation of the e-Waste Policy. The collaboration with Motivity Labs and Banyan Nation is centered around the State adopting the IoT Solutions in Waste Management, Municipal Administration, Healthcare, and Agri, developed by these firms in the form of pilots. Post successful pilots, these solutions will be considered for mass-scale deployment. Through their MoU, Hanumayamma Innovations and Technologies seals their intention to set up their manufacturing plant in Hyderabad.
Honorable Minister Sri K. T Rama Rao, said, “The 9th policy is the entire gamut of policies, the IoT Policy, brings out the State’s intent to position itself as a global leader in the IoT Space by setting up a comprehensive ecosystem for IoT, and how the government intends to use these technologies through its multiple departments and agencies. The second policy that we launched today, the e-waste management policy, talks of our intent to adopt a sustainable model for development while taking revolutionary initiatives to promote the technology. With these policies, we complete our entire set, including the ICT policy framework and 10 policies aimed at different sectors and emerging technologies. The focus of the Government will now completely shift towards, operationalizing what we have promised across policies. Over the next couple of years, through these measures, our intent is to be known as the most forward looking and conducive State for technology not only in India but across the Globe.”
Jayesh Ranjan, Principal Secretary, ITE&C and I&C, said, “We have taken a rigorous approach towards drafting these policies, as with the previous policies, having received feedback in the form of inputs and constructive criticism from industry experts, research institutions and all our partners. Our immediate focus in the next 2-3 months would be to bring out detailed operational guidelines for these policies. These guidelines will outline the processes put in place to execute the initiatives and avail the financial benefits listed in the Policies, and will help us in the smooth implementation of the policies.”

Startups should articulate their products well to scale-up: KTR
Indian startup ecosystem is constantly evolving. For the start-ups to scale-up and go global, they have to move beyond the mindset of mere problem-solving and inculcate the art of articulating their products better, Telangana IT Minister KT Rama Rao stated at an interactive session at the World Economic Forum’s India Economic Summit being convened in New Delhi.
Quoting the examples of how Silicon Valley and Internet have come to be, he underlined the Government’s role in fostering them in the initial stages. On the similar lines, he added, Telangana Government has also started T-Hub, India’s largest technology incubator, which is providing aspiring entrepreneurs access to mentorship, investors, markets and Governments.
Telangana Government has given the start-ups an opportunity to dabble with the pain points that common man confronts and to come up with solutions. The widely popular RTA m-Wallet is one of the outcomes, he quipped, adding that T-Hub is being further expanded to make it the world’s largest technology incubator.
He said, “Ideas generally get nipped in the bud, but at T-Hub innovators walk in with an idea and walk out with a product.”
When asked to comment on the Government of India’s Startup India initiative, KTR opined that it is not enough to just pump in money. “Governments cannot spur entrepreneurship; it has to come from private sector. However, Governments have to create infrastructure, platforms and regulations that don’t come in the way of doing business. There is a good number of investors worldwide looking for investing in great ideas. There’re not enough ideas. The way forward for an initiative like Start-up India would be to encourage kids to innovate from a young age. Catch them young. Just allocation of money will not help. Governance is not about being seen or heard, it’s about being felt. We need to aid innovation and don’t meddle with it,” he concluded.
Earlier in the day, the Minister met several industry and business leaders on the sidelines of India Economic Summit.
Adi Godrej, chairman, Godrej Group; Kris Gopalakrishnan, executive vice chairman, Infosys; Sumant Sinha, chairman and CEO, ReNew Power; USIBC’s senior directors Messrs Jay Gullish and Abhishek Kishore; Vineet Mittal, chairman, AVAADA Group; K Dilipkumar, president, SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud & MD, SAP Labs India; Yusuff Ali M A, chairman, LuLu Group International; Dipali Goenka, CEO Welspun India; Kazunori Konishi, MD, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries India were among those who interacted with the Minister.
Minister detailed on the transparent, progressive and investor-friendly industrial policies and the plethora of opportunities available in Telangana and invited them to invest and expand their operations.

Govt Launches ‘Smart Streets Lab’ to make Hyderabad roads safer
To improve road safety in Hyderabad with the use of technology, the Government of Telangana, along with WRI India Ross Center, has announced the launch of a novel program, the Smart Streets Lab Telangana on Thursday (10 August). The Lab will pilot innovative road-safety and women safety solutions and leverage new developments in technology and IT to transform the streets of Hyderabad.
Motorization is growing at a fast pace in India today, leading to a rapid expansion in road networks in the recent years. This has, in turn, caused serious impacts on road safety levels, according to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway (MoRTH) data. The data indicates that from 2014 to 2015, the total number of road crashes in India increased by 2.5 percent from 4,89,400 to 5,01,423. Fatalities due to road crashes also increased by 4.6 percent from 1,39,671 to 1,46,133, in this time. Road crash injuries rose by 1.4 percent. While data from 2016 has not been analyzed yet, the numbers are only rising.
India already has the second largest road network in the world, with the total number of vehicles expected to increase to 500-600 million by 2030. WRI research suggests that safer cities tend to be ones with extensive mass transport, good conditions for walking and cycling, and fewer cars on the road driving short distances at safer speeds. Civic authorities can transform roads into ‘smart streets’ by catering to the mobility needs of different users such as the differently abled, the elderly, children and women, and not just vehicles.
Through the Smart Streets Lab, Telangana endeavors to source technological interventions – from interconnected and inter-networking smart devices (also known as Internet of Things) to product innovation that can make the streets truly secure, equitable and easy-to-navigate for citizens of Hyderabad.
An online challenge (www.wricitieshub.org/smartstreetslab) seeking applications for projects designed to make Hyderabad’s streets ‘smart’, has been announced. The challenge will invite innovations that are infrastructure-independent, easy to integrate into the existing systems, aid policy implementation, are affordable and create value for the entire ecosystem, till 1 September 2017. It is open to projects led by civil society, entrepreneurs, technology companies, consortiums and partnerships.
In September, about 10 shortlisted projects will undergo an intensive boot camp – a training aimed at helping the innovators transition from a prototype stage to a revenue generation stage. DLABS the incubation and acceleration arm of the Indian School of Business (ISB), Bosch and WRI India will train the innovators on the pilot design and implementation. From October to December, the Lab will support the launch and operationalization of a few pilots in the city.
Explaining the idea behind the Lab, Jyot Chadha, Director of Urban Innovation, WRI India Ross Center, said, “The Smart Streets Lab is a citizen’s workshop of sorts it attempts to offer the road users a platform, where they can devise tech-based projects that will help the city authorities build safer streets. Cross stakeholder collaborations, bringing together citizens, start-ups, corporates and governments is important to improve road safety in a city like Hyderabad, which is among the most populous urban agglomeration in India.”
Jayesh Ranjan, Principal Secretary, Information Technology, Government of Telangana, added, “With a large number of vehicles on the streets, Hyderabad sees massive traffic congestion every day. Considering the city is an IT hub, there is a great potential in leveraging the technological advancement to find road safety solutions. Such platforms will go a long way in building smarter and efficient cities.”
Aruna Reddy, Head of Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE) at ISB, says, “We are excited to bring our research expertise and the experience of working with the local ecosystem to support entrepreneurs and innovations that can help make our cities more dynamic, safe and livable.”

Digital transactions put TS on top
By: Mandhumula Pradeep
With a huge 22.26 crore digital transactions post demonetisation, Telangana has bagged number one position in e-transactions in the country.
Union IT Ministry data revealed that the transactions were more than double when compared to the first quarter after demonetisation when 10.2 crore digital transactions took place in the State. The National e-tall (Electronic Transactions Aggregation and Analysis Layer) portal under the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, which provides statistics of National and State-level e-Governance Projects, including mission mode projects, recorded the digital transactions in the State from the past six months. Telangana ranked first in digital transactions followed by Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh.
The e-Transaction count recorded that 1.59 crore digital transactions took place in fifteen days from May 1 in the State while Kerala finishes second with only 97 lakh transactions.
According to the ETAA data, Telangana is number one in per capital transactions with 6,326 e-transactions per 1,000 people. This is credited to the intensive awareness campaign by the State government to go for cashless transactions. Other southern States such as Kerala and AP are ranked second and third respectively with the digital per capita transactions of 4,300 and 4,100.
After the demonetisation drive, the State government took various measures to encourage digital transactions. As a pilot project, Ibhrahimpur village was declared first cashless village in the State and ranked number two in entire country. The State government encouraged villagers to go for cashless transactions for even their grocery needs. Later, the State government asked all department officials to go for cashless transactions, including commercial tax, village panchayats, civil supplies, transport, electricity and all other government payments.
“Special drive was conducted by the State to make people pay utility bills online,” Finance Secretary Ramakrishna Rao said. Adding this, he said additional 10,000 Point of Sale (POS) machines were purchased after the demonetisation to encourage the digital transactions in the State. The State government had already interlinked 195 public services to various digital portals to encourage people to opt for digital way and to curb the intervention of middlemen.
Out of 22.26 crore digital transactions, interestingly the highest number of transactions (13.8 crore) were done in Rural Development Department. The State recorded 8.43 crore transactions in Employment Guarantee Scheme for payment of wages through digital mode. All the EGS card holders are asked to open bank accounts and payments were directly credited to their accounts,” said Minister for Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Jupally Krishna Rao.
After several appeals from the State government and encouragement given by the Energy Department, people also favoured paying their power, water, LRS and house tax bills online. Nearly, power bills worth Rs 43 lakh were paid online. The surge in e-transactions will help the State government to weed out corruption and help the citizens save their time, observed Finance Department officials.

Telangana tops in investment growth
Reiterating that Telangana is making good progress after coming into being in 2014, an Assocham study said the investment growth rate in the newest State during the past three years (2014-17) has been 68.5 per cent compared to the national average of 20.8 per cent.
Releasing the findings of a study – ‘Telangana: Economic Growth and Investment Performance, on Thursday here, its national secretary general DS Rawat and senior managing committee Babu Lal Jain said that Telangana had attracted total outstanding investments worth about Rs. 5.9 lakh crore as of March 2017. For comparison, Telangana, which was one of the three regions in the undivided Andhra Pradesh, secured Rs. 3.3 lakh crore worth of investments as of March 2012.
Telangana accounted for 3.3 per cent share in total investments worth Rs. 177 lakh crore attracted by the top industrial States across India for 2016-17, said the study by the Assocham Economic Research Bureau.
In terms of year-on-year growth in investment, Telangana (as part of Andhra Pradesh) had seen a 0.6 per cent growth in 2012-13 and 5.6 per cent in 2013-14. The growth in investment was 24 per cent in 2014-15 (after the State is bifurcated), 22 per cent in 2015-16 and about 12 per cent in 2016-17.
Over a fourth of the total investments attracted by Telangana are in the irrigation sector (28 per cent) as of March 2017. It is followed by non-financial services (25 per cent), electricity (18.5 per cent) and manufacturing (11 per cent). About 370 projects with investments worth about Rs. 4 lakh crore of the total investments attracted by the State are under different stages of implementation, said the study which analysed multiple growth parameters.
The under-implementation rate of projects was 78 per cent in 2015-16 and has reduced to 66 per cent in 2016-17. Nationally, it remained constant at 54 per cent for the past two years.
The study said the State’s economy accounted for over four per cent of share gross value added (GVA) across India as of March 2017. It said Telangana has outperformed the national average in terms of economic growth. The State recorded 8.5 per cent growth in 2016-17 when compared to the national average of 6.6 per cent during the same period. Agriculture recorded about 15 per cent year-on-year growth in 2016-17 after registering an over six per cent in 2015-16. It had shown a negative growth of ten per cent in 2014-15 due to deficit rainfall.
In services, the State recorded a ten per cent growth in 2016-17 compared to 8.4 per cent (in the region as part of AP) in 2012-13. The State’s industrial growth was 10 per cent in 2015-16 and 4.1 per cent in 2016-17 even as it registered a negative growth of 7.5 cent in 2014-15.
“The State is doing well in terms of growth. However, sustaining the growth will be a challenge and that should be the focus,” said Rawat.
Fast tracking irrigation projects, improving productivity and yield in agriculture through public-private partnerships and developing industrial sector will be key. The State should design policies to lure investments in biotechnology, solar energy, tourism to generate more employment opportunities for the youth, he suggested.

Press Release
Telangana govt generates Rs. 73,000 crore investment, 2.56 lakh jobs in two years
The Telangana government has allocated a budget of Rs1,200 crore to the textile sector for 2017-18, of which Rs373 crore is for handlooms and Rs827 crore for powerlooms and their modernization and other schemes, said state information technology and industries minister K. T. Rama Rao on Monday.
Rao, who released the Department of Industries and Commerce’s 2016-17 annual report on Monday, said that Telangana generated Rs73,000 crore in investments and created 2.56 lakh jobs in the process, after the state government started the Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self-Certification System (TS-IPASS) post the programme’s launch in 2015.
According to its website, the TS-IPASS is a system in which an industrial application has to be cleared within 1 to 30 days depending on the complexity of the approval.
The department’s annual report showed that Telangana managed to achieve a 10.1% year-on-year of growth in gross state domestic product (GSDP), compared to the national average of 7.1% in 2016-17. “The state’s economy in the national gross domestic product (GDP) has increased seven basis points (from 4.21% to 4.28%) in 2016-17 against 2015-16,” Rao stated.
The industries minister also said that thanks to TS-IPASS, Telangana was ranked first in the ease of doing business (EODB) reforms for 2015-16 (conducted by the World Bank).
He announced that a handful of industrial parks are set to be established in Telangana. Among them are the Kakatiya Integrated Mega Textiles park, Sircilla Apparel park, four mega food parks at Nizamabad, Gadwal, Khammam and Sangareddy.
Another aspect of the industries sector in Telangana that Rao highlighted was that the mineral department had generated a revenue of Rs3,169 crore, which was 103% of the required target and had attained a growth rate of 34%, which was highest among all states.
“The revenue from sand (mining) revenue was about Rs400 crore in the same period. It was just Rs10 crore (per year) before the state’s bifurcation,” Rao added.
Genome Valley, the cluster which is home to over 200 companies, is being expanded with more than 2 million sq.ft of laboratory/incubation space in partnership with IKP Knowledge Park and MN Science and Technology Park, Rao said, adding that a dry port will also be set up at Nalgonda district in the coming days.
On implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) from July, Rao said the Centre should take the advice and suggestions of all states.
“We are still talking to the Centre. It is a learning process and we will have to work with the Central government to make sure that the industries do not suffer,” he said, pointing out that Telangana was one of the first states to ratify the GST Act.

Amazon leases 6 lakh square feet office space in Hyderabad
By: Sobia Khan
The Indian unit of US retail giant Amazon has leased 6 lakh square feet of office space in Hyderabad, making it one of the largest office space deals this year. The deal was closed last week.
The under construction property in Madhapur suburb of Hyderabad is owned by Phoenix Group. “In the first phase, Amazon will occupy 2,50,000 sq ft with an option to expand it to 6 lakh sq ft over the next one and a half years,” said a person having direct knowledge of the development.
“It will be occupied in two phases. Amazon will be paying a rent of around Rs. 54 per sq ft. The facility will be ready by the end of December,” this person said.
Amazon said: “As a company policy, we do not comment on what we may or may not do in the future”. Amazon India has outperformed rival Flipkart in terms of occupying large office spaces.
The ecommerce firm occupies 3.1 million sq ft of office space in India, more than four times the 7 lakh sq ft that Flipkart has on rent.
“The American company has services here that cater to its global operations and that require space. The new facility will cater to overall ecommerce business of Amazon,” said another person aware of the development.
Amazon has also been serving the rest of the world from India. A fresh 3 million sq ft facility is set to come up in Hyderabad in two years to house technology development and back-end operations of Amazon’s global business. Amazon also has over 27 fulfilment centres in India.
Hyderabad is emerging as a hot destination for corporates looking to expand their presence but low supply remains a challenge for these firms.
Recently, Microsoft signed a 15-year lease deal for nearly 2,00,000 sq ft of premium office space at Knowledge City in Hyderabad, and plans to pick another 2,50,000 sq ft of space in its next phase of expansion.
“Business sentiments have certainly improved and this is clear in office leasing trends,” said Veera Babu, managing director, at Cushman and Wakefield, Hyderabad. “We have seen several companies looking at a long-term perspective and pre-leasing office space. For 2017, more than 70% of the upcoming space is already leased and there are active enquiries for space coming up in 2018 and 2019.”
According to JLL India, Hyderabad has the third-lowest vacancy level among all metros at 9%, and is behind Bengaluru and Pune, which have 4% and 5% vacancy levels, respectively.

Press Release
Telangana government looking to set up more IT hubs beyond Hyderabad
By: Yunus Y. Lasania
Since its inception, the Hitech City area in Hyderabad has been the go-to destination for a host of information technology (IT) companies, even drawing big names such as Facebook Inc and Google. But the central business district, which houses more than 1,000 companies, may no longer be the jewel in Hyderabad’s crown as the Telangana government is now trying to spread the sector to smaller districts and mandals like Khammam, Karimnagar and Warangal to decentralize and create more such destinations across the state.
As a result of the Telangana Rural Technology Centres 2016 policy, two big companies—Cyient Ltd and Eclat Health Solutions—have set up full-fledged operations in Warangal and Karimnagar districts. Last week, Telangana IT minister K. T. Rama Rao also laid the foundation stone for setting up an IT incubation centre in Khammam district, and allotment letters have been given to seven companies.
“(An amount of) Rs25 crore has been sanctioned by the state government to develop IT incubation centres in Khammam and Karimnagar districts. We wanted to decentralize the IT sector, as it was concentrated only in Hyderabad, unlike in other states like Karnataka or Maharashtra. After a point, there will be a resource and infrastructure crunch in Hyderabad,” said Dileep Konatham, director, digital media, department of communication technology, electronics and communications.
B. V. R. Mohan Reddy, founder and executive chairman of Cyient Ltd and former chairman of industry lobby Nasscom, said that spreading to rural centres has its own advantages and challenges as well. The positives, according to him, include marginally lower cost structures, availability of local talent at entry-level and creation of “rural jobs”.
Reddy said the availability or willingness of the middle and senior managements to move to tier-2 towns, which lack infrastructure like hospitals, schools, hotels and restaurants compared to the capital city, were a challenge. “The other being a customer’s acceptance on account of poor connectivity,” he said in an email response.
Other companies like Ventois Software (Dallas, US) and Kakatiya IT Solutions have also set up operations at the IT incubation tower in Warangal. But shifting operations to a tier-2 city or any other rural centre means that companies will face infrastructural and manpower hurdles, as both are easily available in a big city like Hyderabad.
“If someone agrees to go there (tier-2 cities), we provide them benefits. The philosophy behind the policy is to offset what you are missing. We give a bigger power rebate and lots of subsidies for Internet (connections), because unlike in Hyderabad, you have to spend a lot on connectivity in a rural area,” said Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary, IT department, government of Telangana.
Ranjan also pointed out that if a company goes further beyond tier-2 cities, to a mandal headquarter, it will get additional benefits like reimbursement of property tax by the state government. “Another important responsibility is to provide manpower to these companies as well. So, the worry of training or running around is taken care of by the government,” he added.
For that, the state government has established the Telangana Academy of Skill and Knowledge (TASK). So far, the 527 engineering and other graduation colleges have tied up with the Telangana government, and over 60,000 students have been trained through TASK’s initiatives.
Another incentive for IT companies going to tier-2 cities is government procurement. Ranjan said a company in Huzoorabad mandal, which had developed an app for corporates called the Visitor Management System, has now been asked to design something similar for the government secretariat as well. “We could have given it to TCS (Tata Consultancy Services),” Ranjan added.

Minister launches T-SAT network, logo
Minister for IT and Industries KT Rama Rao has expressed the State government’s desire to have its own satellite which would telecast content related to education and competitive examinations among others.
According to the Minister, the government broadcasts via two channels using satellite technology from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). “But eventually the goal is to have one satellite of our own in the orbit with the help of ISRO. Using this satellite, we should be able to telecast 10 to 12 channels,” Rama Rao said after launching T-SAT — the satellite TV network operated by Society for Telangana State Network (SoFTNET) under the aegis of the Department of Information Technology, Electronics and Communication — in Hyderabad on Wednesday.
T-SAT Network is the rebranded version of ManaTV, which will telecast programmes on education, livelihood opportunities, health care, agriculture and employment, among other subjects, through its two channels Vidya and Nipuna. The logo, mobile app, brochure and theme song of T-SAT too were launched.
T-SAT, Rama Rao said, stood for Telangana – Skills, Academic and Training, and its motto was to ‘Educate, Enlighten and Empower’. Minister for Agriculture Pocharam Srinivas Reddy said programmes in T-SAT should have a mix of agricultural language with technology. “These programmes will help farmers harvest a good yield and also reduce their debt,” the Minister said, adding that scientists, professors and agriculture extension officers will help disseminate information to farmers using T-SAT.
Minister for Health C. Laxma Reddy said there was a need to create awareness among people over preventive measures that have to be taken in order to avoid diseases. T-SAT, he said, will come in handy for disseminating information on different diseases too.
IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan, CEO of SoFTNET R Shailesh Reddy, Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society Secretary RS Praveen Kumar, Director of National Remote Sensing Centre YVN Krishna Murthy, Digital Media Director Dileep Konatham attended the launch.

Press Release
Hyderabad all set to host Global Entrepreneurship Summit 2017
In yet another major event that will turn the world’s focus towards Hyderabad, the city is all set to host the Global Entrepreneurship Summit 2017 (GES2017) in November. The event will have US President Donald J Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump leading the US delegation.
An official announcement on this came from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who on Thursday announced that Hyderabad would be the venue for GES2017, being jointly hosted by India and the United States from November 28 to 30.
Modi posted a series of tweets on the GES, first announcing that India and US would co-host the Global Entrepreneurship Summit at Hyderabad from November 28-30, and tagged both Trump and Ivanka in the tweet. In another tweet, he said Ivanka would lead the US delegation to Hyderabad. Modi also said the Summit was a unique opportunity for bringing together entrepreneurs and startups with global leaders.
Following Modi’s tweets, Ivanka retweeted him, indirectly confirming her visit to Hyderabad.
Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao, following the announcement, said Hyderabad was proud to host the event. The participation of global players in the event would be a major encouragement for budding entrepreneurs here. The Chief Minister also thanked the Prime Minister for sharing the details and announcing on social media that Hyderabad would host the event.
In response to the Prime Minister’s tweets, IT and Industries Minister K T Rama Rao said Telangana would make sure that the event showcased India’s potential to the world. Thanking Modi for the opportunity given to Hyderabad, Rao said the world’s largest and oldest democracies coming together to spur innovation and entrepreneurship was bound to create new avenues for the future. Rao also said all those in Hyderabad/Telangana were looking forward to welcoming and hosting Ivanka Trump and her delegation along with delegations from other nations.
The GES is not the only major event that the city will be hosting in the near future. The city was earlier selected as the venue of the World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT) in 2018. It will be the first time that the event is being held in India.
Incidentally, during the IT Minister’s US trip in October 2016, Director, Global Entrepreneurship Programme in the US government, Tom Lersten and his colleague Travis had met Rao and sought to know more about Hyderabad regarding hosting the GES.
The Minister had highlighted the positives Hyderabad had to offer to host the event and why it was the best location for such a prestigious event. Rao had told the US team that Telangana was keen to host the event.

Telangana takes incubation hubs to farmlands with iHub
Taking the concept of incubation hubs to the farmland, the Telangana government and ICRISAT launched an iHub on Monday. The innovation hub (iHub) will provide a platform for agricultural technology entrepreneurs, scientists and others to collaborate and develop cutting edge ideas that will help improve the value chain for farmers holding small parcels of land.
The facility was inaugurated at the International Crop Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics here in the city by agriculture minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy who was accompanied by IT minister KT Rama Rao. Developments coming from the new facility, Srinivas Reddy said, should help farmers reduce their investments, increase productivity and ultimately free them from the need to seek crop loans every year. The iHub is spread over 10,000 sq ft at ICRISAT and will include a 40-seat accelerator facility.
KTR said technology can play an important role to help a distressed sector such as agriculture emerge out of the problems it faces. “Technology is the key to empowering our farmers and to improve productivity. Science cannot be for the sake of science and unless it changes things on the ground for the common person we cannot say that we’ve been able to make a social and economic impact,” he said.
A high-level advisory council will guide iHub activities. The council comprises principal secretaries of Agriculture and IT, Parthasarathi and Jayesh Ranjan, managing director of Microsoft India Anil Bhansali, senior vice-president of T-Hub Rama Iyer, vice-chancellor of Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University Dr Praveen Rao and ICRISAT director general David Bergvinson.

EmTech India 2017: K.T. Rama Rao outlines digital plans for Telangana
K.T. Rama Rao said in the next 18 months, Telangana will become the first state in the country to provide proper broadband connection to every household.
New Delhi: The information technology (IT) minister of Telangana, K.T. Rama Rao, claimed on Thursday he was working on creating a digital ecosystem to ensure a better society with advanced e-commerce, e-health and e-education facilities in the state.
Addressing industry executives at EmTech India 2017, the Mint-MIT Technology Review conference on technology and innovations in New Delhi, Rao said his state, in the next 18 months, will become the first in the country to provide proper broadband connection to every household along with potable drinking water supply.
Rao said the idea was to synergize and use the trenches dug for pipelines of drinking water for laying down fibre optic networks for broadband connection.
“When we started laying down plans for providing portable drinking water to every house (around 10 million houses) of Telangana, we realized that we would be laying nearly 120,000 km of new pipelines. We decided to synergize other things on to the same trench and the plan to lay down fibre optic network was also finalized,” added Rao.
He emphasized on digital infrastructure and digital literacy as the major aspects of creating a digital ecosystem. “Unless technology has social impact embedded into it, it is futile,” he added.
Since the launch of T-Hub last year, Hyderabad has witnessed a threefold increase in start-up activity. Currently, the city has over 30 incubators and co-working spaces. T-Hub aims to forge many such partnerships with governments and corporates across the world to setup T-Bridge centres, to strengthen trade relations and attract investment into the state of Telangana.
T-Bridge program claims to provide a platform for fast-track tech companies looking to tap into India’s huge consumer market for technology. Speaking on encouraging new ideas and innovations in the state, Rao added, “We have to find out formulas and customize technology to the Indian requirement. The T-Bridge allows Indian start-ups to cross-pollinate ideas and create channels of knowledge transfer from multiple countries around the world.”
The program also aims to create a network of mentors, venture capitals, incubators and accelerators that is advantageous to the Indian start-up ecosystem.
He further expressed that India’s strength lies in its workforce population as 65% of Indians are below 35 years of age. “The opportunities for the government to create jobs in sunrise sectors like cyber security, multimedia, entertainment, animation, gaming and designing are plenty,” he added.

Inauguration of Datawind manufacturing facility
DataWind announced formal launch of its manufacturing facility at GMR Complex of Rajiv Gandhi International Airport here, its second facility in the country.
Telangana IT and Industry Minister KT Rama Rao and Nadir Patel, High Commissioner of Canada, inaugurated the facility.
DataWind had earlier this year, signed an MoU with the Telangana government in this regard.
Rama Rao congratulated DataWind President and CEO Suneet Singh Tuli and his team for setting up the facility in Telangana and employing 600 people.
“Telangana government will provide full support to them to ensure their operations are streamlined and successful. The investment made by DataWind will not only contribute to the revenue of the state but will also be instrumental in generating jobs,” Rama Rao said, adding DataWind will be doubling its head-count to 1,000 by March next year.
“We created a mobile manufacturing ecosystem in the state. Telangana State Electronic Manufacturing Policy has been a success and in 6 to 7 months, we have three major manufacturers — Micromax, Celkon and DataWind setting up their units here,” he further said.
Telangana, which was ranked 13th last year, has risen to number one position in ease of doing business ranking, he said.
European TV manufacturer Thompson is coming to Telangana in tandem with a local company, he said and urged the High Commissioner to ensure that the Prime Minister of Canada, who is expected to visit India, also visits Telangana.
He also sought help of the High Commissioner to put in a word with Air Canada to connect its services to Hyderabad.
DataWind has set up its Hyderabad facility with a phased investment of Rs 100 crore and the facility will manufacture 2 million units (tablets and smart phones) in the first year, whereas at full capacity it can reach up to 5 million units.

ZF Opens First Technology Center in India
Germany-based ZF Friedrichshafen AG, a driveline and chassis technology provider, which also offers active and passive safety technology opened its first technology centre in India in Hyderabad. The ZF India Technology Center (ITC) will strengthen ZF’s presence in the country with expected investment of €15 million (Rs 105 crore) over the next five years.
The company which announced its plans to set up this centre in September last year established it in just 6-7 months. This centre will employ 2,500 professionals by 2020.
The ITC will be involved in high-end innovations, which will focus on bringing advanced technology to India as well as localising strategic business activities including research, design and development for global markets. It will also leverage academic research communities and talent pool for global development projects.
Integrated approach
He informed, “We will be launching more products with high degree of Indian content going forward. We will increase production capacities in Pune as more demand picks up. Hyderabad centre will play a key role in integrating with ZF’s other centres. We have also tied up technology partners such as TCS and Tech Mahindra besides several others.”
“All over the world, there is a change in mobility, automation and interest in cars. With growing global warming, automotive transmissions and emissions have become critical. There is a growing important of zero emissions and zero accidents and ZF is striving to create technologies that ensure them,” Stefan said.
The new centre will be involved in electronics, embedded software and mechanical engineering. It will support ZF’s global development teams while enabling the company to accelerate local product development supporting ZF automotive and non-automotive operations and customers in India.
Mamatha Chamarthi, chief digital officer of ZF, added, “The India Technology Center will be rapidly integrated into the engineering ecosystem of ZF and become a pillar of innovation for the company. As demand for software engineering grows, ZF will exponentially increase capacity to help meet customers’ growth aspirations in both the global and local market.”
Investing in Telangana
ZF and its partners have been operating for more than five decades in the Indian market, with corporate headquarters at ZF Business Park, Pune. Today, ZF is present in 21 locations serving the automotive and non-automotive segments in the region, including two wholly owned subsidiaries of ZF and six joint ventures of ZF and ZF TRW.
In India, the Group has a strong local mechanical engineering team that supports product development and application engineering for both the automotive and non-automotive customers. The consolidated resource strength for the group, including the joint ventures is about 14,000 employees.
Innovation and CSR
On the CSR front, ZF is tying up with Akshay Patra foundation, a non-profit organisation providing mid-day meals to children, by sponsoring a van to transport food to schools in remote locations in Hyderabad. By this activity nearly 5,000 students from government schools will be benefiting, reducing starvation of underserved children.

Launch of Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad
Innovation is driving nations and the world. Hyderabad has many research institutions and incubators to nurture innovation that could benefit industry to come out with innovative products, said, Telangana Industries Minister KT Rama Rao while announcing the launch of Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad (RICH) on Friday.
The city has the largest number of incubators in the country. He pointed out, “We have 20 incubators operating across verticals, including T-Hub for IT, agri-incubator in ICRISAT and an incubator in IIT. Hyderabad is also planning to create an incubator for defence sector and is initiating talks with the Ministry of Defence in this regard. We just don’t want to restrict ourselves to science and research but achieve strides in innovation as well.”
India as a country has wealth of talent and intellect which needs to be tapped fully. The country has the largest work force and youth under 35 years. The way Japan and Korea have made a mark for innovation, India should also make efforts in the right direction.
KT Rama Rao added research institutions need not always depend on government funding but can explore avenues to collaborate among the institutions and the industry to expand their research efforts. Researchers should drive innovation and disruption.
“India is an emerging nation and there could be funding challenges. But we have the ability and skills and there is an urgent need to collaborate. It’s time we stop operating in silos. Efforts should be made to bring research to market,” he said.
Its important that State governments make efforts to encourage innovation in addition to the Central government. Education, research and development, innovation, incubation and commercialisation should be integrated. Initiatives such as RICH should operate in hub and spoke mode and provide benefits to rural India, Y.S. Chowdary, Minister of State for Science and Technology.
R.A. Mashelkar, former director general of CSIR, said, India has abundant talent in science and research and this should translate into innovation. Venture capital funds should be available for this. There is a startup culture evolving and India should utilise this.

Google to help Telangana go digital
Google India and the Government of Telangana have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to support the digitisation efforts in the State.
The announcement was made after a meeting between KT Rama Rao, Minister for IT E&C, MAUD, Industries & Commerce, Mines & Geology, Public Enterprises and NRI Affairs, and Google India representatives.
As part of the MoU, Google India will provide Google Cloud credits and access to all cloud platform products to eligible startups engaged with Telangana government’s T-Hub initiative and through its Developer Relations team provide technical mentorship and advisory support to various startups.
Both sides will also make all government sites mobile friendly and introduce programmes to help local small and medium businesses get online and stay safe online. Google India will introduce Android Fundamentals courses for students pursuing B.Tech/BE & MCA to skill them on mobile app development.
Google as part of Google Cultural Institute project also will work with the Culture and Tourism Department of the State to create a digital repository of the architectural and cultural heritage, its history and imagery and make it accessible globally.
Google and the Government of Telangana will also promote digital literacy among rural women in Telangana through the ‘Internet Saathi’ programme. It will start by training women trainers identified from Self Help Groups and Women’s federations which are overseen and facilitated by Tata Trusts through its field partners on ground. These master trainers called “Saathis” will further train more women in their own and neighbouring villages.
Chetan Krishnaswamy, Director- Public Policy, Google India said “We look forward to working with the State government to create an enabling environment and ecosystem to help women, students, small and medium businesses and entrepreneurs to realise the full potential of the internet and the opportunities it offers.”
KT Rama Rao said “Google is a valuable partner of the State of Telangana and we are excited to launch many initiatives with them that will benefit women, small businesses, youth, and others across our state.
Our mission is to Digitize Telangana and a partnership with Google will go a long way in ensuring our plans under the Digitize Telangana programme are achieved.”

Telangana star performer in digital transactions post demonetisation
By: Krishna Prasad
Telangana has registered the highest number of e-transactions in the country post-demonetisation.
With just a 3.51-crore population, the state topped all categories of digital transactions. It recorded over 15 crore digital transactions during the last five months. The share of digital economy in the state reached 5% of the gross state domestic product in another feather in the cap of the state.
According to data sourced from the Electronic Transaction Aggregation & Analysis Layer, a government of India initiative to monitor digital transactions across the country, Telangana is racing ahead towards becoming a cashless society. “More than 450 workshops on digital transactions were conducted to train 5,75,448 people at village level and 2,34,000 small businessmen have been trained in digital transactions,” said Union labour minister Bandaru Dattatreya. After demonetisation, 50 lakh new bank accounts were opened taking the total to 88.9 lakh. Of 21.36 lakh NREGA accounts, 19.86 were seeded with Aadhaar numbers and 2.40 lakh Rupay cards activated. The state reported a healthy spread of electronic operations in 127 government and private services. The highest number of e-transactions were reported in rural development services such as NREGA musters, and weekly payments, followed by commercial tax services such as collection of VAT and online central sales tax returns.
“Increase in the digital transactions has helped us in beating the demonetisation effects and ensured regular tax revenue to the exchequer. It has also improved transparency,” said K Ramakrishna Rao, state principal finance secretary.
T-Wallet, a state government initiative, is expected to start from April 1. Speaking about the delay, IT minister KTR said, after the Centre’s BHIM app, efforts were being made to upgrade T-Wallet.

IT Minister KT. Rama Rao launched the one GBPS internet connection of ACT Fibernet in Hyderabad here on Thursday. The one GBPS wired broadband connection is priced at Rs 5,999 per month.
Speaking on the occasion, KT. Rama Rao said faster internet services in Telangana would help fulfil the Government’s vision of making Telangana a tech and digitally advanced hub.
Telangana Government would soon connect secretariat, Assembly, Raj Bhavan, CMO on the 1 GBPS link. Mr. Rao also asked ACT Fibernet to connect the schools, embark on digital library and also upgrade the Chikkadpally Central Library with a 1 GBPS connection to help students.
ACT chief executive officer Bala Malladi said the facility would transform the way internet was now being consumed at large and fast track the government’s target to connect all in Telangana through internet by 2018. “We are privileged to launch 1 Gbps in Hyderabad for the first time in India,” he said. This can be used for connecting any number of devices seamlessly. It will be priced Rs 5,999 per month.”
Telangana will shortly launch 3,000 wifi spots in the city and 1000 of them will be handled by ACT, said Jayesh Ranjan, IT secretary.

Press Release
Lopsided Development Fuelling Migration: KT Rama Rao
By: Kaushik Vaidya
Migration in search of employment and a better livelihood will continue “unless we address this lopsided development that is happening across the country,” says KT Rama Rao, Telangana’s minister for industries and commerce, urban development, and information technology, in an interview with BloombergQuint.
The minister admits that the agriculture sector is in a state of distress across the country despite significant government intervention. In Telangana’s case, power and water are offered free of cost and loans are interest-free for agriculture. The “permanent solution”, he says, is for the state to harness its irrigation potential fully.
Telangana will spend Rs 1.75 lakh crore on irrigation over the next five years. In March 2015, the state’s Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao launched Mission Kakatiya to replenish and rejuvenate 46,000 lakes and tanks. The programme is named after a dynasty that ruled over present-day Warangal between 1163 and 1323, which promoted the construction of many reservoirs and tanks in the region.
Framework For Growth
The state government wants to “infuse capital into creating more urban infrastructure, and at the same time, try to create urban amenities in rural areas as well,” says Rao, in an answer to a question on urban clusters driving growth. Asked to reply to the same report which shows that three-fourths of the state’s workforce have no family member with a salary or a wage – implying large-scale informal employment – Rao says the way to more formal employment is through “more job creators in India by way of ensuring that they are abled and not stifled by the system that we have around us.”
Doubling Down On Technology
Then there’s the paradox that promoting technology also leads to automation and a potential loss of semi-skilled jobs. There’s a way out, and perhaps even a silver lining here, believes Rao. “Any challenge that is thrown up by way of automation or an invention definitely presents an opportunity right next to it. Cyber security, data analytics, data centres are the next waves of growth. The country has to embrace the change that is sweeping the world.”

Press Release
Inside T-Hub: Hyderabad’s startup revolution and Telangana govt’s daring experiment
By Ramanathan S
No Indian government has attempted anything like T-Hub before, and Minister KT Rama Rao’s gamble could be paying off.
Catalyst T-Hub
As the Second World War ended in 1945, a few German economists developed an appetite for an economic system which was neither as centrally planned and controlled as the Soviet Union’s, nor one which left everything to the free market. These economists believed in capitalism and rejected government intervention, but also held that the state had a strong role to play in creating a stable economy. The result: Ordoliberalism.
Ordoliberals believed that capitalism requires a strong government to create a legal environment and framework which enables competition, prevents monopolies and provides policies that free markets need to function most efficiently. The government’s job was to ensure that markets worked, without its interference.
On June 5, 2014, just a day after he took oath as the first Minister of Information Technology of India’s youngest state of Telangana, K Taraka Rama Rao, known simply as KTR, was sitting in a conference room at the Indian School of Business (ISB) campus in Hyderabad. He had one simple question for Srinivas Kollipara: What can the new government do to make Hyderabad the startup capital of the country?
In 2014, Kollipara was among the very few people in the world who had developed a deep understanding of how startup ecosystems were built, studying their growth as a science. A serial investor himself, he had worked through the dotcom boom and bust in the US in a biotech company. He was then mentoring startups and had helped 65 teams come on board the incubator program at the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) in Hyderabad.
“When KTR called, I didn’t really want to do anything with the government because of the way they usually work. But KTR was very clear from the beginning, the government will keep away from the daily affairs,” he says.
This was the genesis of T-Hub, India’s largest startup incubator and perhaps the first ordoliberal experiment in the space, even if the founders don’t necessarily subscribe to the German economic ideology.
Minister of IT KT Rama Rao
KTR did publicly proclaim that they would stay away from it as much as possible. In an interview in 2015, KTR had said, “We wanted it to be as un-government like as possible. I don’t think entrepreneurs can thrive in a government-like environment.” T-Hub would be “completely autonomous” and “free spirited”, just the way entrepreneurs in a free-market economy prefer, he had said.
The T-Hub journey begins
T Hub is an incubator, but also a unique public-private partnership between the government of Telangana, IIIT-Hyderabad, ISB and NALSAR, and other private sector players. And T-Hub is not just an incubator which support startups through their journey, it is a startup which is creating a startup ecosystem in Hyderabad to make the city the startup capital of India.
The concept of T-Hub is this: it is anchored at an impressive building called CatalysT inside the IIIT campus in Hyderabad. The building is a 70,000 square feet co-working space where startups get access to infrastructure, networking opportunities, workshops and assistance from the senior management team of T-Hub, in return for a small monthly fee. A few startups are on board the LAB/32 program, through which T- Hub helps startups become successful businesses in return for a small stake in them.
T-Hub is at the intersection of government, corporates, venture capitalists, research sector and startups.
“By 2014, our IIIT incubator had managed to create a startup culture in Hyderabad. In fact, many success stories like RedBus and Bookpad attributed to Bengaluru actually have roots in this city. But no one was bringing things together to take it to the next level. That’s what T-Hub does,” says Kollipara.
Srinivas Kollipara, COO, T Hub
The role of the government here is simple – it is only a facilitator. The broad framework and policies have been created, and capital expenditure of Rs. 40 crore was allotted by the government. T-Hub is run by professionals with zero government intervention, and has to become financially sustainable on its own. No handholding by the government. If it fails, it fails. If the startups in the incubator cannot scale up, they will be weeded out.
Today, T-Hub supports 200 startups in the co-working space and guide 5 incubatees in which they have a stake.
A monument and a dream-team
The CatalysT building is a monument in itself. A five-storey creative ensemble by W Design Studio in Hyderabad, it is a high-energy, colourful and vibrant working space which is extremely agile and unorthodox. “It is a mix between the corporate world and college campus. The building had to be creative and inspirational, and suitable for low budgets and long-working hours put in by entrepreneurs,” says Gokul Krishna of W Design.
Inside T-Hub
As one walks into CatalysT, the silent energy of ideas is hard to miss. It’s a space where a 3D printer is being tested in one corner, and VCs are discussing investments with startups in another.
Another key member of the project is Jayesh Ranjan, the IT secretary of Telangana, a bureaucrat with wide-ranging public policy experience from some of the best universities and institutions in the world.
Kollipara, KTR and Jayesh knew that throwing money at Hyderabad was not going to make it a startup capital. There had to be a sound business model, a clear vision, the willingness to learn along the way – and all of it had to be built on top of the existing foundations of the city. “To build something like this, we need a strong minister, an IT secretary who gets it, and most importantly, the right person to execute the plans,” says Kollipara.
Just as the idea was taking shape, a few members of what is today the Board of T-Hub got together and decided to task a hiring firm to find a CEO for the company.
Jayesh Ranjan, IT Secretary, Telangana
In March 2015, serial entrepreneur Jay Krishnan had pretty much made up his mind to return to the US after a stint in Bengaluru, when he got the call from the hiring firm. In May that year, he was presenting to the T Hub board members his vision for the company.
“Interestingly, there were many similarities between what Srinivas had thought through and what I had articulated. There was a lot of common ground there, of course there were differences too,” recalls Jay Krishnan.
He was hired as the CEO and moved to Hyderabad in July, and worked as the ‘construction manager’ for their landmark structure until the official launch of T-Hub in November 2015.
Jay Krishnan was the person Srinivas was looking for, a serial entrepreneur who had seen through successes, acquisitions and failures in the startup world. Described by a Hyderabad-based business reporter as “almost too cute to be a CEO”, Jay Krishnan, along with Srinivas, is part of the team of two key heavily-accented executives who run T-Hub.
A semi-conductor engineer, Jay Krishnan was a ‘PIGS’. “Poor India Graduate Student in the US,” he explains, “and all that mattered to us was Apartment Department Advisor Budweiser.” His first venture in 1996 was a partnership with his thesis advisor at the University of Connecticut, Hartford, spun out of his thesis. The company got acquired for its intellectual property, and since then he has worked in three startups over 10 years and put in another 10 years in the corporate space. He also worked on a startup in Bengaluru, which was later acquired by the Birla group.
“It’s almost an entrepreneurial challenge to put Hyderabad on the world’s startup map,” he explains, “and just like any startup, if framework and policies are well defined, it becomes a scalable organization by just hiring people.”
Jay Krishnan, CEO, T Hub
Under his leadership, T-Hub has now broken even. “Through our co-working space rentals, we now have enough income to cover our fixed expenditure every month,” says Jay Krishnan. T-Hub has multiple revenue streams: rental income from workspace, events and workshops they conduct in the building and divesting stake in companies that they invest in at a later stage. But their main job is to create a startup ecosystem.
Firing up startups, the Hyderabadi way
“If you look at incubators in general, they are designed to fail because you are targeting a customer base which has a probability of 10% success. 90% of the startups across the world fail. Incubators don’t have the magic wand to make that any better. So we are not here to change that, but to tell the 90% to learn from their mistakes and come back and build a successful company,” Jay Krishnan explains.
Instead of trying to replicate Silicon Valley, T-Hub has chosen 6 key sectors from which they would incubate startups, and all of them were chosen based on the strengths of Hyderabad as a city. Health technology, agricultural technology, financial technology, transport and logistics, sustainability and social sector are their key areas.
For the startups incubated at the Hub, the partnership has catalyzed their growth immensely.
Mukesh Chandra, founder and CMO of fin-tech company Paymatrix which is incubated at T-Hub, recalls how the partnership threw doors open for them in the market. “We had a good idea and the technology, but not all banks and payment gateways were willing to work with us. There were some lingering doubts. But once we came on board T-Hub, they were confident,” says Chandra.
Paymatrix is a service which allows users to pay housing rent using their credit card and also helps them with rental documentation. In the near future, Paymatrix will also allow peer-to-peer lending as well. So if you are out of cash, you could borrow money from small lenders registered as non-banking financial companies for your rent through this service.
“The networking opportunities which T-Hub provided us helped us a lot. The senior management monitors us very closely, helps us leverage the brand of T-Hub. We have been able to crack better deals,” says Anusha Kurupathi Parambil, founder and CEO of Paymatrix.
Founders of Paymatrix
In fact, T-Hub itself has been a great market for them. Many other startups who use the co-working space at CatalysT pay for it through Paymatrix.
For Ravi Bhogu of Monitra Healthcare, also incubated at T-Hub, it is the infrastructure and atmosphere which have won his team over. “The team’s motivation is high in this working space. We love to be here, and this has shown in our productivity,” says Bhogu, the founder and CEO of Monitra. He also says that experts facilitated by T-Hub have helped him change his global strategy for the better with important insights.
The company builds health monitoring devices which can be used by the patient easily, while carrying on with daily life. The company has designed a device to pre-empt cardiac arrests
Earlier this year, Life Circle Health Services, a home nursing and professional care services provider incubated in T-Hub, raised $150,000 from European healthcare services provider Groupe SOS. The startup offers subscription-based care-giving and home-nursing services.
Another app being developed under the supervision of T Hub is WOWSOME, which solves marketers’ problems using augmented reality. The platform provides computer-vision-based solutions which merge creative advertising and digital marketing – for instance, a well-designed visiting card with a QR code which brings your smartphone to life with details about the person or business entity.
T-Hub has also managed to get institutions like Samsung and ICRISAT on board as partners, and this helps startups gain exposure on the one hand, and help corporates keep a close eye on the fast-evolving market.
Converting euphoria to substance
Yet, they still have a long way to go, says Jay Krishnan. “One of the problems with Indian startups is that they are not solving problems of India. Ecommerce was a big success in the US because it really was needed at that point. We have copy-pasted these ideas in India. T Hub faces the same problems too,” he says.
“Indian startups are more about euphoria and less about substance, and they just chase capital rather than being the next frontier in technology,” Jay Krishnan says. He adds that Indian startups also have a sense of entitlement: “They think they should get funding just because they have an idea.”
The signal-noise levels in Hyderabad, however, are lower he says. “Bengaluru has a lot of good ideas – the signals – but there is too much noise too. So it’s difficult to find the right guys there,” he comments.
Further, the economic philosophy of the new state government itself is a great playing field. If their taxi-aggregators policy is anything to go by, they strongly believe in letting markets do their job. In spite of immense pressure, sources say, the Telangana government has not banned surge-pricing or overregulated services like Uber, letting startups disrupt the market. “I can’t speak for the government, but at T-Hub we believe in the power of the markets to solve problems,” he says.
Even as some of their companies get funded, and many others lose steam and bow out, the Telangana government has approved phase-II of T-Hub – another incubator in Hyderabad with the same team, but with 5 times the present footprint and an investment of Rs. 175 crore. They have established a chapter of T-Hub in Silicon Valley, to get companies abroad to set up shop in Hyderabad, and help companies here access the global arena.
Kollipara is creating a framework which ensures that they remain accountable to the government, but operate independently: “We are an independent non-profit. We are the government’s partner and in terms of the structure we are isolated. And we will ensure we will remain so, whatever the future holds.”

Press Release
Minister inaugurates T-Bridge, an outpost of T-Hub, in Silicon Valley
Minister for Industries & Commerce, IT, MA & UD and NRI Affairs Sri KT Rama Rao, inaugurated T-Bridge, an initiative that connects India’s start-up ecosystem with that of the world’s, at Uber’s headquarters in San Francisco. Under the T-Bridge programme, Telangana forged partnerships with Uber, TiE Silicon Valley and California Governor’s incubator iHub. Telangana becomes the first State in India to come up with such a novel idea.
T-Bridge is a logical extension to India’s largest startup ecosystem builder, T-Hub. T-Bridge will connect Indian startups with global market opportunities, and help bring global startups to India. T-Bridge will enable startup communities in India and around the world to cross-pollinate ideas, innovate and create channels for knowledge transfer. It will also create a network of mentors, VCs, incubators and accelerators that is advantageous to the Indian startup ecosystem.
Indian startups will now have access to international investors and hence are poised to get better valuations.
Telangana is now recognized as one of the world’s leading destinations for startups within India. The city of Hyderabad offers some of India’s best infrastructure, a large and growing technology talent pool, and a vibrant, cosmopolitan international community. Of particular significance to innovative tech startups worldwide is Telangana’s great position as a gateway to leveraging India’s massive technology markets. Startups can hit the ground running instead of being buried in red tape. T-Bridge will provide a platform for such fast-track tech companies looking to tap into India’s huge consumer market for technology. T-Bridge will help startups access UberEXCHANGE, Uber’s flagship startup mentorship program and TiE Silicon Valley’s mentor network.
Addressing the gathering from startup ecosystem at the T-Bridge launch event, Sri KT Rama Rao stated, “We have a strong vision to make Hyderabad one of the top 10 startup cities in the world. T–Bridge is one such move towards opening a channel of investment from the world to the state of Telangana. I am proud to open our first outpost in the U.S. in association with Uber and TiE Silicon Valley and believe that this association will forge new partnerships and spur investment and innovation between the two countries”.
Sri Ram K. Reddy, incoming President of TiE Silicon Valley stated at the inauguration, “The Telangana government has been one of India’s most progressive states. The vitality and transformational mindset of its leadership gained quick acceptance within the startup world. TiE Silicon Valley is pleased to host the first T-Bridge outpost in Silicon Valley.”
Ms Rachel Whetstone, Uber’s senior vice president for policy and communications, said, “Telangana is one of the most progressive states in India; and it has set up a culture of ‘regulatory incubation’ — allowing new ideas and business models to thrive. Today more and more people around the world want to build something themselves. Through initiatives like UberEXCHANGE, our mentorship program for Indian startups, we hope to spur entrepreneurship.
Creative partnerships like T-Bridge will continue to strengthen ties between India and the global startup scene.”
Sri Jayesh Ranjan, Secretary, IT E&C Department, Sri Srinivas Kollipara, COO, T-Hub, Sri Dileep Konatham, Director, Digital Media wing, IT E&C Department were also present at the inaugural event of T-Bridge.

Press Release
Intel India announces the Intel & DST Innovate for Digital India Challenge 2.0
By Swati Rathori
In a release, Intel said that this year’s challenge aims to inspire grassroots innovation and harness local talent by inviting makers across India to build solutions to accelerate India’s digitization and commercially develop their prototypes on Intel Architecture.
This year, the challenge will be rolled out in five phases, with the grand finale taking place in April 2017. Shortlisted teams will be eligible to receive a Rs 3 lakh grant each, to create minimum-viable products (MVPs) based on Intel Architecture in an accelerator program at the T-Hub incubator in Hyderabad. The winning team will get Rs 20 lakh to further their project development.
Debjani Ghosh, Managing Director and Vice-President, Sales & Marketing, Intel South Asia said, “Innovation is the key ingredient for making the Digital India vision a reality and we need a local, sustainable innovation ecosystem to address the country’s challenges. Our goal is to foster innovation at every level – from school to colleges and from entrepreneurs to enterprises. With this announcement, we continue to create a community of makers who build solutions to enable the scalability of technology adoption in India, and increase the impact of technology on citizens’ lives.”
MyGov Chief Executive Officer Gaurav Dwivedi said that last year there were six ideas under the challenge that completed the mind-to-market journey and are already making their solutions available in the Indian healthcare and agriculture sectors.
Lauding the initiative, Telangana Minister for IT, MA&UD, Industries and Commerce, KT Rama Rao said he expects this initiative to bring some breakthrough ideas and ingenious innovations to the table, and strengthen India’s position as a knowledge economy.

Press Release
Minister KT Rama Rao meets Sri Lanka Prime Minister
Minister KTR met the hon’ble Prime Minister of Sri Lanka Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe and thanked him for inviting him to the Human Capital Summit.
The hon’ble Prime Minister pointed out that Hyderabad has become the technology hub.
Minister KTR apprised him of the progress Telangana has made since it came into being and various policy initiatives to enable ease of doing business. The strengths of the state in terms of IT and technology hub, pharma, aerospace and defense and textiles were highlighted by the Minister.
The hon’ble PM appreciated the efforts made by the Telangana State in such a short span. He pointed out that as a part of India -Sri Lanka joint cooperation to make South Asia as a regional force to be reckoned with and as a part of of the balance of power shifting to this part of the world, there exists a huge potential for collaboration between Sri Lanka and among the 5 southern states of India including Telangana. The PM highlighted that Sri Lanka wants to create 1 million jobs in next 5 years, revive rural economy and will expand middle class. It will open up its economy to attract FDI and it is the effort to make SL as a logistic and business Hub.
Minister KTR suggested that as a part of this joint economic cooperation, Telangana can play a major role in IT sector and that a team of top IT companies from Telangana will visit Colombo in near future. Similarly, Telangana plans to start the textile park and companies from Sri Lanka (especially in garments and apparels) can play a major role in the park by becoming anchor units.
Minister KTR requested the PM to start a direct flight between Colombo and Hyderabad. The PM assured that it will be considered favorably in view of the large tourist inflows to Colombo from Hyderebad and from the region.
The PM appreciated T-Hub and commented that this is a perfect example of the education-employment continuum, a model Sri Lanka wants to have.
Minister KTR invited the hon’ble PM to visit Hyderabad. The PM has assured to consider it favorably during his forthcoming visit to India in October 2016.

Press Release
Minister Speech at Human Capital Summit 2016
Minister KTR address at the Human Capital Summit 2016 held in Colombo, Sri Lanka on 11 August, 2016.
The full text of Minister’s Speech:
“Building a Future Ready Workforce – Indian Experience”
I have been asked to speak on how the federal administration in India enhances the employability and competitiveness of employees and job seekers and thereby building a workforce which meets the challenging needs of the Indian economy. As you are perhaps aware, I represent Telangana State, the newest and youngest state which is just two years old as we speak. In that sense, I prefer to call ourselves “a Start-up State”.
Before I come to the nitty-gritties, let me start by pointing out that in India, while some of the subjects such as defense are in the exclusive domain of the federal government, there are subjects while are in the concurrent list i.e. which are in the domain of both federal and state governments and then, we have subjects which are exclusively in the domain of the State governments. While its ultimately the state government where the action lies, the best results are obtained when there’s synergy between the two.
Let me start with the global trends in human capital and skills eco-system. It’s not surprising that landscape is becomingever more complex and evolving ever more rapidly. Firstly, we see a paradoxical mismatch between the requirements of labour, their availability and yet the two don’t match! Approximately 25,000 new workers will continue to enter the labour market in the emerging markets every day until 2020, and more than 200 million people globally continue to be outof a job; yet, simultaneously, there is an expected shortage of some 50 million high-skilled job applicants over the coming decade. Secondly, a new wave of technological innovation, which has already started—a Fourth Industrial Revolution—will bring radical change to industries and labour markets worldwide. I am strongly of the opinion, contrary to apprehensions from certain quarters that the Digital talent platforms have the potential to empower millions of poor and marginalized workers to access the global labour market as never before. This new jobs landscape—where work is global, even if workers are not—can create opportunities for developing countries to leapfrog technological development stages by equipping their workforces to directly tap into the global labour market. Lastly, the transition from education to employment has become fraught with uncertainty around the world. Globally, nearly 35% of our human capital potential remains undeveloped, due to lack of learning or employment opportunities or both or the mismatch between the two as it is often observed that many of today’s education systems are disconnected from the skillsneeded to function in today’s labour markets.
The importance of a strong education base cannot be overstated. The Human Capital Index 2016 prepared by the World Economic Forum which takes a life-course approach to human capital and in the process evaluating 130 countries based on the levels of education, skills and employment available to people in five distinct age groups, starting from under 15 years to over 65 years, points out that only 19 nations have realized their Human Capital Potential by more than 80% while two regions i.e. South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa have yet to realize 60%. The Index covers six countries from the South Asia region and the bright spot for the region, Sri Lanka (50), benefits from strong educational enrolment and basic education completion rates as well as positive perceptions of the quality of its primary schools and education system overall (23rd on both). India does well on Quality of education system (39th), Staff training (46th) and Ease of finding skilled employees (45th) indicators, suggesting a primary avenue for improvement for the country consists in expanding access to its numerous learning and employment opportunities.
Let’s look at how the Indian scenario looks like. The share of agriculture sector in overall GDP is on decline. While the agrarian work-force too is declining, it’s slower than that of GDP’s share implying falling agrarian income. There is a strong case for and a push factor for this work force to look for new avenues. Economic development is associated with the development of the agricultural sector, followed by development in the manufacturing, and at a later stage by development in services. This so-called Three-Sector Hypothesis appears consistent with cross-country evidence.
There thus is a need to create an eco system by concentrating on sectors especially in manufacturing and services sectors which have employment potential in them and can create ripple effect through backward and forward linkages. This implies that there should be a labour force which is available and which has the required skills set. The importance of apprenticeship and industry related work experience thus become extremely crucial to have the employability of the labour. Mere numbers aren’t important, quality however is.
India has one of the youngest populations in the world, with more than 54% being below 25 years, and an estimated 62%, being in the working age is grouped between 15– 59 years. Thus, while the country has a huge advantage of demographics and the ‘adolescents-youth-bulge”, traditionally, till recently, there is a significant skill gap resulting in lack of availability of “readily-employable workforce”. With only less than 8% percent of the total workforce in India having undergone formal skill training as compared to 68% in the UK and 52% in the US, the quantum of the challenge was high. Harnessing the demographic dividend through appropriate skill development efforts would provide an opportunity to achieve inclusion and enhance productivity within the country. More than 700 million Indians are estimated to enter the working age group by 2022, of which the government has set a target to skill 500 million people by 2022.India has realized the need for a well thought out and executed strategy to provide a new set of skills through vocational training.
This being the case, lets now discuss what are the steps being initiated by the Government of India. For a long time, Skills up-gradation and training were synonymous with Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) These ITIs have been in existence for decades now at the district level and provide the basic training skill sets in some of the more conventional trades and industries. However, the gap continues and this has made a strong case for a renewed look and effort. The main reason why it didn’t get the scale up it should have earlier was a bit of disconnect with the changing industry requirements and disjointed efforts by different agencies involved.
Thus, realizing the importance, skill development and empowering human capital has on the economy and for the overall well being, Government of India has initiated number of measures since 2015 and I would like to highlight some of the major path-breaking initiatives. I will mention few important path breaking federal institutional initiatives:
The National Skill Development Mission was officially launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on the occasion of World Youth Skills Day in July 2015. The Mission has been developed to create convergence across sectors and States in terms of skill training activities. Further, to achieve the vision of ‘Skilled India’, the National Skill Development Mission would not only consolidate and coordinate skilling efforts, but also expedite decision making across sectors to achieve skilling at scale with speed and standards. Mission Directorate will be supported by three other institutions: National Skill Development Agency (NSDA), National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), and Directorate General of Training (DGT). Seven sub-missions have been proposed initially to act as building blocks for achieving overall objectives of the Mission.
Further, for the first time in 68 years of India’s independence distinct ministry i.e. Ministry for Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) has been formed to focus on enhancing employability of the youth through skill development and to fulfill the version of creation of a ‘Skilled India’ where human resource development is in primary focus.
In order to engage private sector who is ultimately the major employer, The National Skill Development Corporation India (NSDC) was setup as a one of its kind, Public Private Partnership Company with the primary mandate of catalyzing the skills landscape in India. NSDC operates through partnerships with multiple stakeholders in catalysing and evolving the skilling ecosystem which include private sector, international engagements, federal ministries, state governments, universities and Non profit organisations. The achievement within a short span has been spectacular.
While the Government of India has provided the policy framework for Skilled India and Human capital, its ultimately the states, as I said a bit earlier who have to make them operational. More importantly, the efforts in skill up-gradation have to go hands in hands with the overall economic momentum and outlook in these states. This also explains why some states do better than others. The overall eco-system which includes policies of the state government to promote manufacturing, ease of doing business, systemic transparency, readiness of the state including ready infrastructure, housing, overall law & order situation and assured power supply, sets the stage upon which skill up-gradation, based on the specific demand sets, will be a major engine of growth and employment And I would like to take you through the efforts made in my home state.
Telangana, as I mentioned earlier is the youngest and newest state in India. It is the 12th largest state in our country and about 42% of its population is urban. We realized the importance of creating a healthy eco-system and a parallel focus on skill development. Within six months of its formation, a number of short and medium term measures were initiated which ensured availability of an assured and uninterrupted power supply. The state will be adding more than 14000 MWs of its own capacity in next three years. We have also created a land bank of 150,000 acres for exclusive usage for industries and manufacturing. An online web based interactive single form based approval process which is based entirely on the self certification was put in place wherein approvals for setting up a new manufacturing unit are granted within 15 days. It’s the RIGHT of the investor to get time bound approval through an ACT. It is thus no surprise that since the launch of our new Industrial policy called TS-IPASS in June 2015, a total of 2300 manufacturing units were given approval with an investment potential of Rs 46000 crores and with an assured confirmed direct employment potential of at least 175000. Such a spectacular progress is unheard of. What used to be achieved in a decade earlier is now made possible in less than couple of years. The rate of manufacturing and industrial growth is about 16% in the state and we plan to build up further.
A new Pharma city called the Hyderabad Pharma City is planned in an area of about 14000 acres which will be the regional hub for bulk drugs, formulations, APIs. It will house certification agencies, will have R&D facilities including a full fledged research university. Likewise, a textile park is coming up in Warangal in an area of 2000 acres which will be an all inclusive value chain fibre to fabric concept.
Further, Telangana has been a leader in IT and services sector. Some of the top names including Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have their largest offshore offices in Hyderabad. Companies such as Novartis have more than 7000 workforce operating from Hyderabad. The list is never ending and growing. Telangana Government’s T-Hub is the most prestigious and largest incubation centre in the country for start ups in Hyderabad.
You may wonder why am I harping on the hunger of the state to grow? It’s mainly because it sets the stage. We now have to ensure that there is a seamless supply and availability of labour force with the required skill sets. And we have initiated parallel steps in this direction.
We realize that as state, we need to be the catalyst and enabler. In order to have better synergies between research, innovation and realizing their commercial potential, we are in the process of setting up RICH (Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderbad) and to encourage budding start ups, will set up a dedicated research to market funds (RMFs).
The state also is in the process of setting up Telangana State Skills Mission which will be an umbrella for all skill based activities and will coordinate the functioning to existing skill institutes. It will provide the necessary bridge between the industry and its requirements on the one hand and linking them up with various teaching institutions including introduction of new courses and mandatory internships in real life industries. The idea is to prepare the youth based on real life requirements. We aim to provide skill based employment to atleast a million people in coming 5 years.
In this regard ladies and gentlemen, I wish to highlight The Telangana Academy for Skill and Knowledge– TASK, an agency already established by the Government of Telangana for bringing synergy between Government, Academia, and Industry with an objective of enhancing skilling of youth in the State.
Initiatives from TASK focused on ‘enhancing employability quotient for youth’ and this means designing skilling initiatives creatively, those that are based on industry requirements (Technical , Personal and Organizational Skills). TASK’s direct tie up with technology partners, such as IBM, SAP, CISCO, Oracle to name a few, assist in delivering basic and advanced training and certification at subsidized costs across the state for both students and faculty.
The need of the hour is to design training programs with an integrated skilling approach as training is no longer going to be restricted to vocational ones but also micro-entrepreneurship training that can encourage budding entrepreneurs to start their ventures independently or improvise if they already have any. We are also looking at creating a robust policy for the state, enhancing industry ties and proliferation across districts, to reach out to communities in all parts of the state and skill the untapped potential that can be used to make this a reality.
Another unique feature of our skilling module is the synergy created by the induction of experienced professionals from the corporate into the government. This increases access to the high-level skills which in turn translates into innovation and growth in newer landscapes.
To conclude, I am of the opinion, we as state instruments will have to play the role of enabler in skill development and need to create mechanisms and systems where market forces of demand and supply in skills are matched. The overall eco-system in the state creates a stage for developmental take off and empowerment of human capital at every level of skill needs will provide the geometric progression in employment and growth. The present structure of competitive federalism among the states in India is extremely healthy and welcome and is ensuring that all states are geared up for next level of economic development and in the process getting rid of administrative inertia by use of technology and by providing ease of doing business.
I would end by saying “If you think imparting Skills is expensive, try ignoring it” !

ZF Group to Setup a Technology Centre in Hyderabad
By: Ronak Shah
ZF’s new Technology Centre will come up in Hyderabad
The technology centre will be operational by 2017
The company plans to employ around 2,500 engineers by 2020
ZF, the German auto-component manufacturer, will set up its first ever technology centre in Hyderabad, which will focus on the company’s development in software and mechanical engineering. It was just last month that the company’s headquarters in Germany had hinted at setting up a new R&D facility in India and with this announcement it’s very clear that ZF plans to invest heavily here. The technology centre will be operational by 2017 and is expected to employ around 2,500 engineers by 2020.
Globally, ZF has about 13,800 engineers working at various R&D centres and the company has invested 1.38 billion Euros in 2015, for research and development, which is now constituted of more than 100 development locations. ZF’s first Technology Centre in India will be fully operational by 1st January, 2017. This year the component manufacturer has already launched its Electric Park Brake (EPB) technology in India and also inaugurated the ZF Hero Chassis systems Pvt. Ltd., a 50-50 JV between ZF India Pvt. Ltd. and Hero Motors Ltd. in Oragadam, Kanchipuram district.
Dr. Stefan Sommer, CEO of ZF Friedrichshafen AG said: “This new facility is a significant investment for ZF in India. We are harnessing the skilled talent pool that India has to offer; in order to develop superior technology solutions for our global as well as local customers. Over the years, ZF has been successful in localising high technology products in India. As demand for software engineering grows, we will exponentially increase our capacity to help meet our customers’ growth aspirations. With this Technology Centre, we are reinforcing our global R&D footprint as well as our commitment and investment, in the rapidly emerging Indian market,”
ZF has by itself been operating in the Indian market for more than three decades and post the acquisition of TRW in 2015, consequent to its joint venture with TVS and Rane groups, its overall experience, in India, now stands at over 50 years. Currently, including JVs, ZF has 19 production facilities, with about 12,000 employees worldwide.

Minister for IT, Industries, MA & UD and NRI Affairs Sri KT Rama Rao released IT E&C Department’s Annual Report for the year 2015-16 at Tourism Plaza in Begumpet today. Sri Rama Rao, while releasing Annual Report for 2014-15, announced that the Department’s performance report – initiatives and achievements – would be released every year during State Formation Day celebrations. However, due to the Minister’s tour to the USA to promote the State and attract investments, the release event was rescheduled.
Speaking on the occasion, Minister for IT Sri KT Rama Rao said, “Our pro-business policy, high quality infrastructure, cost-effectiveness, cosmopolitanism, presence of institutions like TASK and T-Hub along with an overall pro-active approach has made the State among the top IT destinations in the country. We have continued to grow faster than the national average and have also added thousands of new jobs in the sector. The first two years have given us a very strong foundation from where our leap into the future can only be higher and stronger.”
Sri Jayesh Ranjan, Secretary IT E&C Department said, “Through ICT Policy, we have endeavoured to create an extremely investor-friendly atmosphere and lay foundation for the State to take leadership position in a number of emerging technology areas. During the last year, we supported other government departments in developing ICT applications to improve their internal processes and outreach to their stakeholders.”
Annual Report in brief

Apple, Uber, Flipkart, Salesforce, and DBS are some of those companies, to name a few. Government has also been encouraging IT/ ITES companies to spread to Tier II locations and announced incentives to this effect.
Standing testimony to the Telangana IT Department’s efforts to promote Tier II cities, noted IT major Cyient has started its Development Centre at Warangal in February 2016.
Another major area of focus has been Electronics Manufacturing. Due to the vast potential for large-scale employment and revenues the sector holds, Government of Telangana gave required thrust to the ESDM sector.

The Electronics Policy has several firsts to it and is expected to further accelerate the growth of Electronics Manufacturing in Telangana. Several major Electronics companies are already evincing keen interest to set up their manufacturing facility in the state.

Minister meets industry leaders in Mumbai; bags investments
IT, Panchayat Raj and MAUD Minister Sri KT Rama Rao spent a busy day in Mumbai meeting top industrialists, business bigwigs and other investors and asked them to consider Telangana as destination for their establishment, expansion and investment plans.
Minister Rama Rao met Mr. Tulsi Tanti, CMD Suzlon and invited the Group to invest in Telangana. Suzlon announced to set up 3000 MW of power generation units via solar, wind & hybrid sources by putting in Rs 1200 crore. The Minister assured the Suzlon Group of all support from the Telangana Government.
The Minister later met Executive Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Kotak Mahindra Bank Sri Uday Kotak. Sri Uday promised Minister Rama Rao of more investments and jobs in State from Kotak Group. Specific details are awaited.
Sri KT Rama Rao also met Chairman and Managing Director, Mahindra Group Sri Anand Mahindra and presented the investment opportunities available in Telangana. The Minister later stated that the meeting was satisfactory and hoped that the bond between Telangana and Mahindra Group would be strengthened further.
Principal Secretary, Industries and Commerce Department Sri Arvind Kumar, Secretary, IT E&C Department Sri Jayesh Ranjan accompanied Minister in the meetings.
In a Separate event, Minister KT Rama Rao delivered keynote address at VC Circle Partners Summit in Mumbai today. Mr KT Rama Rao detailed on the investment scenario in the country and the special plans of Telangana Government vis-a-vis attracting investments into new born State of Telangana. More than 2,000 Industrialists, Investors, Funding Agencies took part in the Summit. Highlights of Minister KTR’s speech (in verbatim):
Capital is now gaining the upper hand. Great ideas are now coming through, and investors now have the ability to cherry pick opportunities across sectors. Investment is also going to areas where innovation is happening, not just imitation!From the venture space, where can the large yield-chasing pension funds, sovereign wealth funds etc go? There are a few pockets in the US, and maybe China, but other than that India is the only remaining opportunity of its size and scale. Long term investors with an 8-10 year horizon have a phenomenal opportunity to make returns. India will imitate, maybe localize and in some cases completely innovate.
These days, the government is leading initiatives, both in the centre and in the State. Telangana, we like to call this the youngest startup in the country, has had some real progress in the past couple of years, investments coming in, launching an interesting innovation ecosystem (T-Hub, which I invite all of you to visit). Even anecdotally, in Hyderabad, hotel rates going up, real estate going up, there is a real sense of vibrancy that has come back now.
First of its kind Accelerator Fund in India: Rs 125 Cr. fund, with the State government as the anchor Investor and T-Hub management as the primary General Partner. Unlike standard VC funds, this is a highly risk- free and economics driven engine for limited partner investors.
I firmly believe that leaders everywhere across the political spectrum are now realizing that FDI (and domestic investments) are a critical component, key to keep the flow of capital going, across the economic cycle and are making efforts to ensure that business can be done as smoothly as possible. With the Government, the business of governing well has to be a continuous function, politics as usual will continue forever. Real, complex, large problems to be solved which requires everyone, sometimes even competitors, to work together.
Inclusion and last mile connectivity is now tantamount more than ever. The next level of India’s growth will come from digitizing tier- II & III cities. Technology will play a huge role here – AgriTech, FinTech, HealthTech & EduTech platforms, customized in India, for India will be huge winners.
Five years ago, it was all about Bangalore for VC; Now there are clear, viable alternatives, some of them more attractive on certain parameters. I am not just talking about Hyderabad/Gurgaon/ Mumbai. Places like Pune, Kochi, and a number of tier-II metros are now seeing a lot of entrepreneurial buzz.Competitive Policy making between states within India will see the next wave of catalyzing innovation. States have begun to set the tone for newer, edgier and more competitive policy making. We are now at the beginning of a virtuous cycle. Will see some very exciting growth between now and 2025, probably even more dramatic than what happened between early 1990s and today.

Minister KTR laid foundation stone for Amazon’s biggest campus outside the US
Hyderabad, March 30, 2016: Amazon today announced fresh investments in the state of Telangana with the commencement of work on its new campus in Gachibowli, Hyderabad in the state of Telangana. Spread over nearly 10 acres of land, the new campus will be Amazon’s biggest campus in India and as well as its largest campus outside the US. This marks Amazon’s second significant investment in the state in a matter of one year. Last year Amazon had announced the launch of one of its biggest Fulfilment Centres in the country in Hyderabad. The new state-of-the-art campus is expected to be ready in 2019 and would house thousands of employees managing backend operations for Amazon’s various global business and technology teams.

This new facility promises to add thousands of jobs and provide a fillip to the local economy. We will continue to make all efforts to make Telangana an investor friendly state and help companies like Amazon expand their presence in the region.”
Speaking on the occasion Mr. David Zapolsky, SVP & General Counsel Legal, Amazon said, “Telangana has been home to our IT operations since 2005-06 and our presence in the state has grown multifold since then. With a pool of quality talent, state-of-the art infrastructure and a progressive government, the state was a natural choice for us to set up our largest campus in India here.

Chief Minister Unveils Telangana ICT Policy and Allied Policies
Chief Minister Sri K. Chandrashekar Rao, today unveiled the Telangana ICT Policy, 2016 at Hyderabad International Convention Centre at 3 pm. Along with the primary document, four other Policies viz. Rural Tech Centres Policy, Innovation Policy, Electronics Policy and Gaming & Animation Policy – were also released at a special function organized here. Hon’ble Chief Minister had ceremonially presented the copies of Policies to Sri ESL Narasimhan, Hon’ble Governor Telangana & AP, Sri NR Narayana Murthy Hon’ble Chairman Emeritus, Infosys and Sri KT Rama Rao, Hon’ble Minister for IT, Panchayat Raj and MAUD. Cabinet Ministers, legislators from Telangana, prominent industry, business leaders from different verticals, senior bureaucrats and other stakeholders also graced the event.
On the sidelines of the main programme, twenty five (25) Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and Letters of Intent were signed by the Government of Telangana and its arms TASK and T-Hub with leading financial, educational, business, industry and not-for-profit organizations. The areas covered under the agreements include, but not limited to, financial services, sunrise technologies, Animation, Gaming, Multimedia and Entertainment, ESDM, Communications, Skill Development among others.
Speaking on the occasion, Hon’ble Chief Minister Sri K. Chandrashekar Rao said, “It is well known that many regions of the world today are thriving because of the Information Technology revolution. Hyderabad, Telangana’s crown jewel, is already a magnet which attracts the best in the world, and our government intends to embellish it even further to make it standout as the most preferred destination for the IT companies.
“The new Industrial Policy released by our Government is widely considered to be path-breaking and revolutionary. Coming close on its heels, I am confident that the new IT policy will also be similar in its impact, and will become a role model for the rest of the country.”
Hon’ble Minister for IT, Panchayat Raj and MAUD Sri KT Rama Rao elaborated on the vision of Telangana Government with respect to ICT and allied sectors in the State. He said, “Hyderabad has justifiably earned a reputation for being a welcoming and cosmopolitan city over the last few centuries thanks to the progressive, outward looking attitude of its erstwhile rulers. When the IT sector was opening up in the country in the mid-90s, Hyderabad became a natural choice for the IT majors and positioned itself as a critical national and international IT hub. The presence of leading national research and academic institutions has served to further promote the growth of IT in Hyderabad.
“Lack of agility from key decision-makers during the years leading to the formation of Telangana State resulted in Hyderabad missing out on many opportunities that should have otherwise come its way automatically. I am happy to state that the moments of uncertainty and indecisiveness are all behind us now. We now have a very decisive and focused leadership, which is extremely serious about making amends for the lost years. With a keen appreciation of the importance that the IT sector has to the life of every individual in Telangana, the Government accords highest priority to the further growth of Information Technology in the state, not just in Hyderabad city but also in Tier II, Tier III and other smaller towns and villages.
“Our Policy focuses not only on consolidating our strengths but also on making pioneering efforts into new and emerging areas. We might have got on the IT bus later than others in the past, but I am confident that we will not only be on the bus in time but also drive it.”
Salient features of ICT Policy and other Allied Policies launched today

Is Telangana the new California of east? Apple, Amazon, Google and others line up mega investment plans
By: A Saye Sekhar
Google (search) on your iPhone whether a product is available on Amazon while you are on the move in an Uber taxi. Your nimble fingers would most likely have some tech connect with the most happening Southern City of India, Hyderabad. The uber cool and upwardly mobile people across the globe would surely have been cloud-connected with the city.
Is Telangana the new California in the making? Apple, Amazon, Google, and Uber have queued up to have their second largest development centres, outside the United States of America, in Hyderabad. All within a radius of 10 km.
The city is set to witness a different level of vibrancy with these marquee companies making it the second home. Already, it is home for biggies like Facebook, Microsoft, and Qualcomm.
A beaming K T Rama Rao, Minister for IT of the Government of Telangana, sums it up saying: “Hyderabad is the biggest bang for the buck for all those investing here.”
A ballpark estimate of investments flowing into Hyderabad from various industries is out at close to $3-4 billion, with an estimated employment opportunity for 25,000 people and 1.25 lakh indirectly.
Hyderabad has innate advantages in terms of geographical location and availability of talent pool. KTR ascribes the decision of these global majors for choosing Hyderabad to the “best industrial policy, proactive policies, and a decisive government.”
“This stands testimony to our proactive policy. Hyderabad is the destination for growth. We are a state that is growing very rapidly. IT exports have posted a YoY growth by 16 percent against a national CAGR of 13 percent,” KTR told Firstpost.
Apart from these four, Airbus is proposing to set up a helicopter-manufacturing unit at an estimated investment of Rs 2,500 crore to generate employment for close to 4,500 people. The aircraft maker wanted the Telangana Government to allot 40 acres of land to which the state has shown three different sites close to the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport and asked the company to choose that suits the best to its needs.
A delegation of Airbus recently called on Chief Secretary of Telangana Government Rajiv Sharma and submitted proposals. The company wanted to collaborate either with Tatas or Mahindras in India and it proposed to manufacture 100 choppers a year.
Ikea
Swedish Home furnishings giant IKEA is setting up its India’s first store in Hyderabad. It has purchased land and work is going on at a brisk pace. It has bought 13 acres at a cost of close to Rs 20 crore an acre near the IT Hub.
Uber
Uber opened its Centre of Excellence on 26 February this year. This will have teams of more than 500 customer service specialists to 24/7 assistance to riders and driver partners. “Uber has already hired close to 30 percent of the total team strength and has started support operations from its Center of Excellence in Hyderabad,” an official spokesperson of Uber told Firstpost.
The Center of Excellence will provide support via multiple channels–email, phone and social media to ensure seamless experience before, during and after the ride. The team of specialists will also be proficient in multiple local languages to address support issues from across the country.
Amit Jain, president, Uber India,said: “We are excited to unveil Uber’s centre of excellence in Hyderabad that will be the heart of customer response for our India operations. The government of Telangana has shown great vision in supporting innovative technology companies and continues to remain an ideal location to do business.”
Apple
Apple, one of the world’s richest corporate houses, will establish its world’s next largest technology development centre outside the USA in Hyderabad at a cost of $25 million – close to Rs 175 crore. Though it has considered many cities, including those in Eastern Europe, it has zeroed in on Hyderabad and one of the focus areas for this new centre would be to develop Apple maps. This centre is likely to provide direct employment to 4,500 techies in 250,000 sq. ft in Tishman Speyer’s Waverock building in the City’s IT hub.
Chief Executive of Apple, Timothy Cook had said in a shareholders conference: “The population in India is in some ways some of the best in the world. There’s a huge amount of young people moving up the ranks and the consumer will rise up there.”
Basking the afterglow of signing agreements with world’s biggest corporate houses, Jayesh Ranjan, IT Secretary of the Government of Telangana, told Firstpost: “Apple considered many cities not just in India but also in other geographies like Eastern Europe before finalising on Hyderabad to locate its technology development centre for Apple Maps. This is a very strong endorsement of the value proposition that Hyderabad offers to a marquee company like Apple.
“With this addition, the 4 most valuable companies of the world (Apple, Microsoft, Google & Facebook) will all have their largest development centers outside of the US in Hyderabad. If we add Amazon, the 8th most valuable company of the world, which too is developing its largest development centre outside the US in Hyderabad, we have the enviable distinction of having 4 of the top 4 and 5 of the top 10.”
Google
Google proposed an investment of Rs 1,000 crore staggered in four years to establish its South Asia’s biggest development centre in two million square feet facility in Hyderabad. Google CEO Sunder Pichai announced in December last that the company would set up its largest campus outside the USA in Hyderabad. KTR signed a Memorandum of Understanding with David Radcliffe, global head of facilities and workplaces of Google, in May last year. This will provide an employment for 6,000 people in a 7.2-acre facility in Gachibowli in the City.
The company has already announced that it’s “street view” project in India will begin with Hyderabad.
Amazon
World’s eighth largest corporate, Amazon, too doesn’t want to lag behind. The company, which had already set up its Asia’s largest warehouse (280,000 sq. ft) on the outskirts of Hyderabad, too will have its biggest development centre outside the US here in the City of Pearls. A large chunk of its $2 billion investment is likely to flow into Hyderabad, for the State Government has allotted a 10-acre site for building close to three million square-foot facility that houses a work force of 13,500 people, while the existing headcount of Amazon in Hyderabad is 1,000.
Groundbreaking for this facility is likely to happen in a few days.
Wish there is a day when Zuckerberg, Satya Nadella, Bill Gates, Larry Page, Sunder Pichai, Jeff Bejos, and Tim Cook do a human-chain on the highstreets of Hyderabad.

Today Uber, the technology platform that is changing the way people move around cities, announced that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Telangana to create thousands of jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities, foster technical innovation and research into smart city initiatives and a commitment to make significant investments.
“Shri K T Rama Rao Garu, Hon’ble Minister for IT and Panchayat Raj has shown great vision by supporting innovation and embracing choice. This is an outstanding example of what can be achieved when the private and the public sector work together with the best interests of the local communities at heart to bridge the digital divide in line with Prime Minister Modi’s Digital India initiative,”
Siddharth Shanker, GM Hyderabad, Uber
Uber has a long-term commitment to creating tens of thousands of jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities and redefining car ownership and safer transportation choices for people in Telangana state. The MoU is a visionary step and a significant milestone in how governments and Uber are working together around the world to develop smarter cities.
Sixteen months ago Uber transformed urban mobility for over millions of Indians, when it launched in Hyderabad, by introducing a more safe, reliable and efficient way to move around the city. In fact, the flexibility, entrepreneurial opportunity and earning potential of Uber’s innovative technology has an equally transformational impact on the livelihoods of thousands of driver partners and their families.
The first-of-its-kind MoU between the Government of Telangana and Uber will include the following areas:
Job Creation
Uber will leverage its global model to create unrivalled entrepreneurship opportunities and support tens of thousands of middle class jobs in the state of Telangana.
Uber and the government will partner to create socio-economic opportunities for women and people from resource poor sections of society. Uber will collaborate with The Telangana Academy for Skills and Knowledge (TASK) to identify and train 2000+ candidates by the end of 2016 who will then drive on the Uber platform.
Uber’s Vehicle Finance program and technology platform will facilitate first-time vehicle ownership and provide unrivalled economic opportunities for the successful candidates from the TASK program.
Investment in Hyderabad
Uber will invest upwards of USD 50 million into Hyderabad over the next 5 years to establish a state-of-the-art facility that will house hundreds of new employees.
Hyderabad was always the prefered choice. The supportive and forward thinking government, deep talent pool, excellent real estate and high standard of living were key factors that influenced this decision.
Smart Cities
Uber has always been deeply committed to enhancing people’s lives by revolutionizing urban mobility. Our vision for the City of the Future is one where a city like Hyderabad has fewer cars on the road than it does today leading to roads that are safer and have less congestion and pollution.
Uber will engage with T-Hub and the government and explore synergies to foster the smart cities initiative and technological innovation in the city using big data analysis.
Progressive Regulations
Uber will work closely with the government to develop a new regulatory framework to be passed in the next four weeks for on-demand transportation technology aggregator services that are bringing unprecedented benefits to urban transportation and the lives of thousands of drivers.
As more and more people in Hyderabad choose Uber as their preferred choice, the city strengthens its position at the forefront of innovation for Uber globally. Most recently, in April, Hyderabad was chosen over 320+ other cities as the location for Uber’s global-first cash payment experiment.

CM Sri K.Chandrashekar Rao formally launched the Telangana State Industrial Policy 2015. Ministers Sri Jupally Krishna Rao, Sri Jagadish Reddy and Sri KT Rama Rao also participated in the event.

Plug and play system will be available for them,” Rao said. He also assured 24X7 uninterrupted power supply to industries.

All the permissions required for new industries would be given within two weeks.The chief minister claimed that “Telangana Single Window without grills” slogan attracted the industrialists across the globe.

NASSCOM Foundation keeping with its commitment of responsible e–waste management and Digital literacy will work with its member companies to make more refurbished computers available for this mission. So far, the Foundation’s Big Bridge Program has donated 8000 refurbished computers to over 300 NGOs across the country; thus impacting learning and livelihoods for the excluded.
The National Digital Literacy Mission is a far-sighted, dynamic and integrated platform of digital literacy awareness, education and capacity programmes that will help rural and the underserved communities fully participate in the global digital economy. NASSCOM Foundation is the industry partner to the Government of India to accomplish the first phase goal for NDLM or ‘DISHA’ by making 10 lakh individuals in India digitally literate in the coming few months.

Government of Telangana  aspires to transform the State into a Knowledge Society and make available the benefits of Information Technology to the last mile of the State and to all citizens, especially those in rural areas, not only for providing gainful employment but also for over all socio-economic development.
With Hyderabad as a role model, other Cities in the State of Telangana, i.e., Warangal, Karimnagar, Khammam etc are being developed  as Tier-II IT Hubs.  Special incentives are offered to IT industry to expand their business operations and move to Tier-II locations, which have definite cost arbitrage with abundant availability of physical, social infrastructure, talented skilled human resource, low standard/cost of living, etc., compared to other locations in the country.
Warangal is fast emerging as a promising Tier II IT location in the State.
Warangal is located 148 km north-east of the state capital of Hyderabad and is the administrative headquarters of Warangal District. It is part of a tri-city comprising of Warangal, Hanamkonda and Kazipet.
The city is well connected by road through NH 202 which passes through it. Railway junction at Kazipet connects the city with the State capital. An airstrip in Mamnoor serves as the domestic airport in the city.

Out of the 15000 sq.ft, 6414.00 sq.ft in G+2 floors has plug & play facility with a capacity of 45 workspaces in the Incubation Centre.
Tier II Locations offer significant advantage, in terms of cost of living, operations cost, availability of skilled human resources at low cost, low commuting time, etc. These locations account for over 25% saving, as compared to large cities. To further promote Tier II locations and to motivate ICT industry to set up their operations, the following specific incentives are offered by the State Government:
Reimbursement of Quality Certification
Power Subsidy/Category conversion
Reimbursement of Stamp duty and Registration fee
Patent Filing Costs
Allotment of Government land
Reimbursement of municipal taxes

As a part of TASK, the Government will conduct Faculty Development program for colleges and training institutions located in that area
Recruitment Assistance at the rate of Rs. 20,000 per employee for a minimum annual recruitment of 50 new IT professionals from the colleges located in Telangana. This assistance will be managed and disbursed by TASK
Subsidy to first 5 anchor units employing more than 250 IT and 500 ITeS employees

Cyient will be establishing the state-of-the-art Software Development Center in Madikonda IT SEZ of TSIIC.
The Cyient Software Development Center will be a geospatial technology center with advanced geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, and photogrammetry technologies, catering to a host of solutions for the transport navigation, utilities, and communications sectors. Additionally, the Software Development Center will have world-class spatial data analytics solutions to address the requirements of specialized geospatial data processing services, using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and other point cloud technologies. The facility will support Cyient’s worldwide digital technology initiatives, including those in IoT, big data analytics, and smart cities.

Hyderabad IT industry poised to reach $50 bn by 2025
The Information Technology industry in Hyderabad is poised to grow to $50 billion by 2025, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) said Friday.
The apex industry body turned 25, and to mark the occasion an event was held here Friday night to highlight the evolution of Hyderabad as a key destination for IT services and software in India.
Nasscom vice chairman B.V.R. Mohan Reddy said Nasscom’s contribution in changing the face of the industry was unparalleled.
He said that over the last 25 years, the IT sector grew to become a $120 billion industry in the country.
He said Nasscom’s Hyderabad membership was an important constituent in this accelerated journey.
Since the establishment of the industry in Hyderabad in 1992, the services and products domain here has grown exponentially in terms of both revenue and talent.
From a modest 40,000 square feet Software Technology Park (STP) shared by multiple companies, the sector now boasts of 1,000 acres of land and multinational IT giants.
The IT exports from Hyderabad currently are to the tune of $10 billion.
According to a recent report by Nasscom, over 200 startups have been set up in Hyderabad since 2010 focusing on big data, enterprise solutions and social media.
The region has received immense support from the state government and has rightly earned the name of ‘Cyberabad’ due to the sheer number of IT companies concentrated in the city.
Nasscom will continue to engage with large enterprises, SMEs and entrepreneurs in the city and across the country to evangelize the industry and support it to take the next big leap in the technology revolution, said a statement by the industry body.
It envisions the next 25 years as a journey driven by innovation, ambition and opportunities, which will see unprecedented growth across verticals.

Press Release
TASK & IIIT together establishing Virtual labs to improve the quality of engineering education
Virtual Labs is a mission-mode project initiated by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Govt of India. This is a consortium project of 12 leading technical institutions of India – IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay, IIT Kanpur, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Roorkee, IIT Guwahati, IIT Madras, IIIT Hyderabad, Amrita University, Dayalbagh University, COE Pune, and NIT Surathkal.
IIIT Hyderabad has signed an MoU with Telangana Academy for Skill and Knoweldge (TASK)  to carry forward the outreach activities of Virtual Labs.  According to the MoU, both parties will work closely to reach out to all engineering colleges in Telangana and improve the quality of engineering education in these colleges through the use of Virtual Labs and other technical training programs.
Currently, 150 Virtual labs with about 1500 experiments have already been developed and a large number of these labs are being used by about 150 colleges across the country. Usage pattern of these labs show that these labs are increasingly used ‘outside’ lab hours, which was one of the original motivations for this project.
According to Professor Venkatesh Choppella, Associate Professor at IIIT Hyderabad and co-PI of Virtual Labs, “Virtual Labs is a great initiative for the engineering education in the country. Not only will the students benefit from the access to laboratory experiments developed by the faculties of top technical institutions in the country, this project also has tremendous opportunities for research and development for open sources enthusiasts. This being an Open Source project, it provides open access to developers across the world to contribute to this project and build a world-class learning platform for students.”
According to Sujiv Nair – CEO Task virtual labs addresses the issue of lack of good laboratory facilities, as well as trained teachers, by making remote and simulation-based experimentation possible through the Internet and we are excited to partner with IIIT Hyderabad help spread the awareness and usage of these labs in  Engineering colleges  both in Urban and Rural areas across Telangana.

Industrial Policy Framework for State of Telangana (2014)
PREAMBLE
Industrialization will be the key strategy followed for economic growth and development for Telangana, the 29th state of the country. People of the new state have very high expectations from the Telangana State Government for creating jobs for the youth, promote development of backward areas, maximize growth opportunities by optimum utilization of the available resources, harness the talents and skills of the people, and usher prosperity in every household. Industrialization holds the potential for fulfilling all the dreams and aspirations of the people of Telangana.
The vision for industrialization of Telangana is “Research to Innovation; Innovation to Industry; Industry to Prosperity”. The industrial policy framework will be driven by the slogan of “In Telangana—Innovate, Incubate, Incorporate”. The policy framework intends to provide a business regulatory environment where doing business would be as easy as shaking hands. Innovation and technology will drive the industries of the Telangana State.
The Government of Telangana State realizes that industrial development requires large-scale private sector participation, with the government playing the role of a facilitator and a catalyst. The government is committed to provide a graft-free, hassle-free environment in which the entrepreneurial spirit of local, domestic and international investors will thrive to take up their industrial units in the state of Telangana as the preferred investment destination. The new Industrial Policy will be the instrument through which the vision of the Telangana State Government will be translated into action.
The new Telangana State Industrial Policy will be rooted in certain core values, as follows:
• The Government regulatory framework shall facilitate industrial growth
OBJECTIVES
The new Telangana State Industrial Policy will strive to provide a framework which will not only stabilize and make existing industries more competitive, but also attract and realize new international and national investments in the industrial sector. The focus will be on core manufacturing sectors, with the creation of employment for urban and rural youth and adding value to existing skills emphasised at all stages. It is expected that the most significant outcome of this approach will be the production of high quality goods at the most competitive price, which establishes “Made in Telangana-Made in India” as a brand with high global recognition.
The cornerstone of the policy would be zero graft and zero tolerance to corruption. The decision-making in all Telangana State Departments will be transparent and the departmental heads will held responsible for all acts of omission and commission by departmental staff. An online and help-desk grievance redressal system will be put in place where entrepreneur will be encouraged to report instances of corruption or any delays in performing timely tasks by Telangana State Government departments. Timely and strict disciplinary action will be taken against those employees who violate the parameters of the Industrial Policy Framework.
The Industrial Policy Framework has the following mandate for departments that have any responsibility in the industrialization of the State—Minimum Inspection and Maximum Facilitation.
Minimum inspection would encompass a system of no random inspections without cause. Subject to statutory requirements, the departments will develop a system where each industrial unit is inspected only once in 3/4 years and the cycle of inspections to be fixed in advance. Some random inspections will be planned to keep the industry also in its toes, but these inspections will be with the specific written permission of the head of the department.
Maximum Facilitation would encompass an effective system beyond the conventional single window as the anchor. Self-certification will be encouraged and automatic renewals will be implemented. There will be web based E-helpline facilities as well as physical help-desks at Hyderabad and Districts. Information availability and industry department transactions will be transparent and web enabled. The Office of the Commissioner of Industries and the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation will have a Citizens Charter covering all their activities.
EFFECTIVE SINGLE WINDOW MECHANISM
The Government of Telangana State is determined to create an ecosystem in which the ease of doing business in the state matches and even exceeds the best global standards. Telangana State Government is aware that offering a hassle-free system is considered to be of the highest priority by the industrialists, and accordingly the government will implement a very effective industrial clearance system that will go beyond the traditional single window system. This system, called the Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self-certification System (TS-iPASS), will be strengthened by way of legislation. A Right to Single Window Clearance, on the lines of the Right to Information, will be bestowed for all applicants. Penal action will be imposed on the concerned officers who delay the applications.
This will be at three levels—one for Mega Projects, one for other Large industries, and one for SMEs. The state government will bring out a comprehensive legislation enshrining the above principles for according permissions and clearances for both Mega Projects as well as industrial applications in other categories.
THRUST AREAS AND CORE SECTORS
The Telangana State Government has conducted detailed studies and consulted experts to identify the competitive advantages the state can have, given its geographical location, available resources and skill-base, raw material availability, existing manufacturing practices and expertise, and opening up of new opportunities. Accordingly, the Telangana State Government recognizes the following 14 sectors as thrust areas, investments in which will be accorded a higher priority over others.
Thrust Areas:
1 Life Sciences—including, bulk drugs, formulations,vaccines, nutraceuticals, biologicals, incubation centers, R&D facilities and medical equipment
Hyderabad is the bulk drug and vaccine capital of the country. However, in the past 8-10 years the sector has stagnated. While the leadership in formulations and bulk drugs has to be maintained, new opportunities like life-saving drugs, new vaccines and biologicals have emerged. There is an urgent need to encourage this sector, especially in the emerging life sciences areas.
2 IT Hardware including bio-medical devices, electronics, cellular communications, FAB
Telangana has a robust IT Software sector which will complement IT Hardware. The Government of India has approved and IT Investment Region for Hyderabad as well as two Electronic Manufacturing Clusters. The large health industry in Telangana will support bio-medical devices and medical electronics
3 Precision Engineering, including aviation, aerospace, defence
Hyderabad is home to a large number of defence aero-space and defence research laboratories like DRDO, DRDL, RCI, BDL, MDN, Ordnance Factory, DMRL etc. In addition to the 5 large Tata investments in aero-space, there is also the GMR MRO. A group of innovative aero-space SMEs also exist in Hyderabad which has supplied components to the Chandrayan and Mangalyan initiatives. GOI has also announced 49% FDI in defence sector creating huge investment opportunities.
4 Food processing and nutrition products including dairy, poultry, meat and fisheries
Telangana is a large producer of agro-products like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, fruits and spices. It is also the market leader in the poultry and seed business. There is potential expand into greenhouse and exotic vegetable cultivation. To add value to agro-products and to maintain and expand the existing strengths as well as to partner with the national Food Processing Mission, there is a need to encourage this sector.
5 Automobiles, Transport Vehicles, Auto-components, Tractors and Farm Equipment
The automobile industry is an important sector for any State. The upstream and downstream supplier opportunities will boost the engineering SME sector also. The M&M tractor plant in Telangana and the auto-component SMEs will be the anchor around which the future growth and investments in the automobile sector will emerge
6 Textiles and Apparel, Leather and leather value added products like shoes, purses, bags, artificial material infused and coated textiles, paper and paper products
Telangana is a large producer of long staple cotton. It also is one of the largest producers of raw hide. However, value added production is not there within the State and raw material is exported from the State. The State has a strong base of paper industry. There is tremendous potential for paper and paper products industry in the state due to the growing demand for such products.
7 Plastics and Polymers, Chemicals and Petro-chemical, glass and ceramics
The former combined state of Andhra Pradesh had a PCPIR sanctioned by the GOI. This has gone to the residual State. Plastics, polymers and downstream petro-chemical industry are predominantly in the MSME sector with huge employment potential. The products of this sector are consumed on a daily basis all over the country. This sector is critical for a large number of MSMEs
8 FMCG and Domestic Appliances
The growth rates of the Fast Moving Consumer Goods and Domestic Appliances sector has been phenomenal, even when the country’s economy was slow. Telangana is centrally located in India and for the FMCG and Domestic appliances sectors, transportation costs are very critical. It is important to take advantage of the locational advantage of the state especially for this sector.
9 Engineering and Capital Goods, including castings, foundry and Ferro-alloys and other metallurgical industries
This sector is very important if the State has to capture the entire value chain of the automobile, aero-space, petro-chemicals, domestic appliances, and paper and textile sectors. The thrust areas in this section will provide the supply chain to the other thrust area sectors.
10 Gems and Jewellery
Hyderabadi pearls and lacquer bangles made by local artisans are known all over the world. Value-addition to these traditional products and diversification into other gems and jewellery items will provide the much needed relief to local artisans and craftsmen.
11 Waste Management and Green Technologies
This is the sector that will become mandatory for all industry. Green initiatives can be shown to be profitable. The Telangana State has functional models of SPV/JV efforts of waste management. This sector has tremendous growth potential.
12 Renewable Energy and Solar Parks
This sector is a priority all over the world. The State of Telangana has large extents of land eminently suitable for non-conventional and renewable energy installations
13 Mineral-based and wood-based Industries
Much of the minor mineral wealth of the State like granite, quartz and silica-sand is exported in raw form with minimal processing within the State. Similarly, bamboo and other MDF-suitable plant material also need to be exploited so that sustainable incomes are generated and the regular the forests trees can be saved.
14 Transportation/Logistic Hub/Inland Port/Container Depot
The State of Telangana is land-locked; yet it hopes to become a major destination for international investors. In addition it is centrally located and has the potential to become a major transit and logistic hub.
Each of the above thrust areas will have its own sectoral policy and a structure of incentives. High level advisory panels with private sector and academia experts will be constituted for each of the sectors. An inter-departmental task force for each sector chaired by Special Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary of Industries and Commerce Department will also be in place to achieve the required coordination. Frequent thrust area sector-centric investor meets will be organised to showcase the advantages the state of Telangana offers for that sector. Thrust area sector-centric industrial parks with well-developed infrastructure required for that particular sector will be developed at appropriate locations in the state.
CLASSIFICATION OF PROJECTS
The classification of projects into large, medium, small and micro sectors will be based on the Government of India MSME Ministry definitions as amended from time to time. The definition of a mega project is a Telangana State determined one. Government of India has proposed to raise the investment limits under each category and the classification for now is as follows.
• Mega Projects : Those having investment of above Rs. 200 crores in plant and machinery or providing employment tomore than 1000 persons
SPECIAL FOCUS ON SMEs/MICRO INDUSTRIES
The SMEs and Micro-industries are expected to play a significant role in the new state of Telangana, both in terms of value addition and also in creating employment opportunities. The new Telangana State Industrial Policy will make special provisions for the SME and Micro sectors, as follows:
• Adequate number of smaller plots in Industrial parks for SMEs; developed sheds for Micro units
ANCILLARY/VENDOR DEVELOPMENT
Within each of the core sectors, Telangana State Government is interested in the promotion of the ecosystem covering the entire value chain. An important component of the value chain is the primary suppliers who provide the raw material or the component parts to the anchor manufacturing industry, or provide basic inputs to a service industry. The Telangana State Government will plan each Industrial park in such a way that along with anchor units, enough plots are available for setting up Suppliers/Vendors Park. Since the ancillary units are usually in the SME category, these plots will be smaller in size. Mega projects will have to compulsorily set up a Suppliers/Vendors park to encourage growth of local ancillaries.
PREVENTING INCIPIENT SICKNESS AMONG SMEs
The Telangana State Government intends to create a corpus fund jointly with the industries and their associations which will act as a safety net for SMEs that face any crisis and run the risk of imminent sickness. Telangana State Government will also work closely with the RBI constituted State Level Inter-Institutional Committee (SLIIC) to coordinate revival plans of sick and incipient SMEs.
SPECIAL ASSISTANCE TO WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS
Like SC/ST entrepreneurs, the number of existing women-owned industrial enterprises is very meagre. The Telangana State Government will encourage women entrepreneurs in a big way. Each of the 9 districts of the state (excluding Hyderabad) will have one or more industrial parks exclusively for women. Organizations working for women entrepreneurs like COWE, ALEAP and FICCI-FLO will be invited to partner with the government to identify and train women entrepreneurs, get their project proposals developed, link them to financial institutions and handhold and monitor the progress of their projects. Among women, the government would facilitate more number of entrepreneurs to emerge from socially deprived categories like SCs, STs, BCs and Minorities.
SPECIAL SUPPORT FOR SC/ST ENTREPRENEURS
It is an unfortunate reality that a very minuscule proportion of existing industrial units are owned by SC/ST entrepreneurs. There are a number of structural barriers which the SC/ST entrepreneurs find extremely difficult to overcome. Since the foundation of the new state of Telangana is based on the premise of social justice, the new Telangana State Industrial Policy will take up a number of additional support measures meant to increase entrepreneurship among the SCs/STs. This program will be implemented under the banner of TS-PRIDE—Telangana State Program for Rapid Incubation of Dalit Entrepreneurs and some of these initiatives under T-PRIDE are as follows:
• A special direct funding program for financing SC/ST entrepreneurs will be worked out to utilize the money available under the respective Sub-Plans.
TRADITIONAL ARTS AND HANDICRAFTS
The State of Telangana has a number of internationally recognized forms of traditional arts and handicrafts. These are handicrafts like Nirmal Paintings, Dokra metal work, Bidri ware, Pembarthy Brass ware as well as textiles like Pochampally Ikat, Gadwal saris and Warangal carpets. A number of artisans and craft-persons continue to live on the production of these arts and handicrafts, but there income levels are declining. To improve the productivity and incomes in this sector, the Government of Telangana intends to take a number of actions, including:
• Identification and documentation of arts and crafts
This program will be implemented under the T-HART—Telangana State Handicrafts and Artisans Revival with Technology program.
MARKETING BRAND TELANGANA
Telangana is the 29th and newest State of the Union of India. There is a need to create awareness about the State of Telangana and its brand image. To this end, Telangana State will participate extensively in a large number of national and international trade fairs, conferences and exhibitions so that the strengths and opportunities of the State can be show-cased. The industrial policy of Telangana State has also to be publicised widely. In addition to promoting the brand image of the state, it is also essential to promote the SMEs of the state. The State will actively promote the participation of Telangana SMEs in trade fairs, expositions, buyer seller meets and other such events. The State will also leverage all funds available from Government of India schemes under the MSME, Commerce, Textiles, and Pharmaceutical Departments and sector specific Export Promotion Councils to promote State SMEs. Adequate budget support will be provided for marketing the State and the industrial and craft products of the State.
INDUSTRIAL LAND BANK
It is estimated that about 20 lakh acres of land is available in the state that has been identified as unfit for cultivation in Telangana. Based on a detailed survey of these land parcels and identification of those parcels that are fit for industrial use, an industrial land bank for the State of Telangana will be developed. Such lands would be transferred to the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC). Once the lands so identified are transferred to the TSIIC, the TSIIC will determine the suitability of each land parcel for setting up core sector specific Industrial Parks. The core sectors are those sectors listed earlier in the new Industrial Policy.Exclusive industrial parks in safe zones will also be created for setting up of red category industries. Some of the industrial parks will also permit multi-sectoral activities and general manufacturing units.
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
The development of industrial and related infrastructure will be the responsibility of the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC). The financial base of the TSIIC will be strengthened and it will be made to function as an effective organization. All lands in the State identified as fit for industrial use will be transferred to the TSIIC. This land asset base will be leveraged to raise finances from the market so that the TSIIC can become independent of Government over a period of time as far as budgetary support is concerned.
The TSIIC will develop all required infrastructure for the sector specific parks like approach roads, water supply, industrial power, and common effluent treatment facilities. TSIIC will raise market loans with Government guarantee and also get initial minimal budgetary support for the creation of the infrastructure in these new industrial parks. It will be ensured that at the time of allotment to industries, all infrastructure facilities are available in the industrial park, and the investor can begin the construction of his unit right from day 1.
CONNECTIVITY
Approach roads of suitable dimension, keeping in mind the nature of industrial activity likely to happen within the park, will be developed to provide connectivity to the nearest national/state highway, railway station and airport. Based on requirement, provision of a railway siding will also be considered.
INDUSTRIAL WATER
To support industrialization, the Government of Telangana will earmark 10% of water from all existing and new irrigation sources for industrial use. Water pipelines will be laid as a part of infrastructure creation for each industrial park by TSIIC. The TSIIC will coordinate with the appropriate department that is responsible for the creation of the Telangana Water Grid so that industrial water for local MSMEs is made available through the Grid.
INDUSTRIAL POWER
The Government of Telangana State recognizes that quality power and uninterrupted power supply are keys to the growth of the industrial sector. The State has a clear short-, medium-, and long-term plans to first overcome the power shortage and eventually become a power surplus state. Accordingly, uninterrupted power supply will be arranged in each industrial park. The government will also explore the possibility of creating a separate DISCOM exclusively for the industrial parks. Further, “open access” power restrictions will be removed as far as possible to enable all types of industries, including MSMEs to be able to access the power exchange.
The Telangana State Government will encourage usage of non-conventional energy for industrial purposes. Both the user industry and the non-conventional energy suppliers will be provided appropriate incentives to encourage investments in non-conventional energy projects, especially solar power.
In large industrial parks, the Government will facilitate setting up of Private Merchant Power Plants. These 300-500 MW power plants will be —interest from Chinese and Singapore based investors dedicated to group of industrial parks and the tariff could be negotiated between industry users and the producer. The Telangana State TRANSCO will facilitate wheeling and transmission.
COMMON EFFLUENT TREATMENT PLANT (CETP)
Every industrial park will be provided with a common effluent treatment plant, depending of the nature of effluents expected from the specified industrial activity. The Telangana State Government will also encourage development of CETP through a Joint Venture/PPP model, since it is possible to operate and maintain a CETP on commercial lines.
INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE
On similar lines, the entire internal infrastructure within an industrial park like internal roads, water distribution lines, drains, waste disposal facilities, etc, will be developed by the TSIIC before lands are allotted to the industrial units.
STATUTORY CLEARANCES FOR THE INDUSTRIAL PARKS
It will be the responsibility of TSIIC to obtain all basic statutory clearances for these Industrial Parks from the appropriate authorities like Land Conversion, Land Use, Layout approval and Environmental Clearance from Ministry of Environment & Forests, Government of India so that the industrial units need not obtain individual clearances.
LAND ALLOTMENT PROCESS
Details of all land parcels that form part of the industrial land bank of
Three empowered bodies will manage the land allotment process in a transparent and objective manner. The State Industrial Promotion Committee (SIPC) headed by the Chief Secretary and including Special Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries/Secretaries from related line departments will finalise land allotment for Mega Projects. A State Level Allotment Committee (SLAC) headed by Managing Director, TSIIC will clear allotments for other Large Projects. All cases of Micro and SME applicants will be handled by the District Industrial Promotion Committee (DIPC) headed by the respective District Collector. Joint Collector will be the Vice-Chairman of the DIPC.
The process of application will be simplified and made web-enabled. All documents required for making application will be available on the website. An On-line application system will be followed, including the facility to upload all documents online. Facility will be available to the applicant to seek any clarification online. In addition, physical Help Desks will also be set up in the Head offices and all the District offices. The above Committees will meet frequently, and strict timelines for allotment according to Citizen’s Charter will be adhered to.
A mechanism will be put in place to realistically assess the actual requirement of land by each applicant. Empanelled technical experts will scrutinise the Detailed Project Report, and based on standard norms for each line of activity, will recommend the actual extent that can be allotted to the applicant. The recommendations of the technical experts will be used by the Committees for finalising land allotment to the applicant.
While making the allotment, the applicant will be required to submit a detailed implementation plan with clear milestones and timelines. The allottee will be held strictly accountable for the progress of his project as per the implementation plan. In case of any wilful default, the allotment will be cancelled and land resumed.
Once the allotment is finalised by the relevant Committee, the applicant will be required to enter into an “Agreement to Sale” with the TSIIC. This will allow him to raise financing by mortgaging the land for project development. However, the title over the land will be conferred through a “Sale Deed” only when the project is completed and commercial production has started. During the construction and project development stage, the original promoter will not be permitted to dilute his equity beyond 51% in the project. “Agreement to Sale” will be cancelled in case any willful default as mentioned above is observed.
Other than the outright sale method of land allotment, allotment of land on long-term lease to the SMEs will also be considered, particularly when no costs have been incurred by the TSIIC in land procurement.
COMMON FACILITY CENTRES AND UTILITY CENTERS
Every Industrial Park will have some number of plots earmarked for Common Facilities like Electricity sub-stations, Police Outposts, Fire stations, e-seva centres, Banks, Petrol stations, Canteens, local shopping, etc. These will be allotted to concerned government agencies or private parties in an objective and transparent manner by following defined criterion.
The Government will also encourage setting up of Utility Centers with the involvement of the private sector. These utility centers will provide dedicated power, water, steam, waste management facilities and other industrial inputs to designated specific or a group of industrial parks. There will be direct and independent contracts between the Utility Center Company and the individual industries in the designated industrial parks.
LAND PRICING
A Price Fixation Committee (PFC) constituted within TSIIC will determine the prices of all the land parcels in different industrial parks by following an objective criterion. The final price will be the aggregate of the prevailing land price in that area as ascertained from the Registration records, the cost incurred in land development and infrastructure creation, and a nominal administrative charge. The land prices will also be displayed on the website, along with other information. The land price will have validity for a specified time period, and will get revised periodically. A separate pricing mechanism will be followed for the plots earmarked for Common Facilities. Land for location of industry will be available on outright purchase/sale or on a lease basis.
LAND ACQUISITION FOR INDUSTRIES
In case none of the land parcels available in the industrial land bank of the government are found suitable by an applicant, and if he prefers a privately owned land, it is possible for the TSIIC to acquire it on his behalf by following the provisions of the prevailing Land Acquisition Act.
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT ON PRIVATE LANDS
Industry will be encouraged in private lands designated for industrial use in spatial planning of HMDA and other urban development authorities in Telangana. Private industrial park developers will be encouraged to pool their lands so that good quality infrastructure can be developed in the TSIIC standards. In case an industry has to be set up in private lands other than that zoned as industrial, Government of Telangana will do its best to change the land use pattern if such conversion is not prohibited by the spatial planning of the area.
SKILL DEVELOPMENT
While encouraging industrial investments on one hand, the Telangana State Government realizes that an important responsibility laid on its shoulders is to make trained and skilled manpower available for the industry’s requirements. The Telangana State Government will accordingly take up appropriate skill development programmes so that technically qualified youth can find employment in industry. These skill development programs have to be industry sector specific and the training package has to be developed in consultation with the industry so that the trained candidates meet industry requirements. Telangana State Government will take support of accredited private sector skill providers in this endeavour. Mega industries will also be especially encouraged to start their own skill development centres within the same industrial park where their unit is located. The Industrial Area Societies will also be encouraged to participate in design and implementing skill development programs.
Skill development programmes would aim to train the youth in getting entry-level jobs, and also upgradation of skills of the existing employees. The skill development programmes targeted at industrial sector jobs will be supported by the government under the ambit of the Telangana State’s Skill Development Mission in general and the Telangana State Accelerated SSI Skills Training (T-ASSIST) program of the Industries and Commerce Department.
INDUSTRIAL TOWNSHIPS
As part of the master plan for the sector specific industrial parks to be developed by TSIIC, provision for mini-industrial townships will be made. The townships will contain executive housing, workers housing, social infrastructure and other amenities. This township development can be initiated by the TSIIC in partnership with established industry groups who have the competence in this field and also other reputed real estate companies. Further, in the vicinity of industrial parks, lands will be zoned as Residential, to enable the private sector to also develop housing for the industrial employees. Separate norms and incentives for the township development will be released as a part of state’s urban development policy.
INDUSTRIAL AREA LOCAL AUTHORITY
As a part of providing a hassle-free environment for the industrial units, the concept of Industrial Area Local Authority (IALA) will be strengthened. All new industrial parks that will be set up by the TSIIC will be covered under the IALA system. All existing TSIIC Industrial Parks which do not have an IALA will adopt the IALA system. This will enable industries to get faster clearances required for starting of construction since the IALA will take advance clearances. The IALA will play an important role in monitoring the compliance of the Industry with self-certified local and national laws and Acts.
INDUSTRIAL INCENTIVES
The Telangana State Government is committed to encourage the process of industrialization by making various kinds of incentives available to the entrepreneurs. The Telangana State Government also assures an entrepreneur-friendly and graft-free regime of disbursing the incentives. The Telangana State Government guarantees that the incentives will be released on time, and direct to the bank account. There will be a transparent on-line application system, with minimum human interface.
There will be enhanced incentive packages for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled tribes, Physically Handicapped, and women entrepreneurs. Mega Projects with an investment of over Rs. 200 crores in plant and machinery or employment above 1000 persons will receive tailor-made incentives in addition to standard largecategory industry incentives.
The Telangana State Government will consider providing incentives to the entrepreneurs in the following areas under its T-IDEA (Telangana State Industrial Development and Entrepreneur Advancement) incentive scheme:
a. Stamp duty reimbursement
Details of general and sector-specific incentives will be issued through Government Orders from time to time and publicized on the website and through other means. While providing incentives to future industries, the Government will also ensure that the existing industries are also benefited.
RATIONALIZATION OF TAXES
A sound industrial policy has to ensure that the state taxation structure is conducive to industrial growth and state financial resource augmentation. Distortions in the tax structure leads to evasion of taxes and clandestine transport of industrial inputs and outputs to neighbouring states, which may have advantageous tax rates. To address this problem, inter-state tax rationalization on industrial inputs and outputs with neighbouring states like Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu will be brought out within a short span of time.
REVIEW OF ALL LAWS IMPACTING INDUSTRY
It is common knowledge that a number of laws and rules that impact industry and industrialization are outdated. For example, the Indian Boilers Act is of 1923 and the Indian Boilers Rules is from the year 1950. The Indian Factories Act is from the year 1948. The Electrical Inspector implements the provisions of the Indian Electricity Rules 1956. The Government of India has also announced its intention to review all legislation and either remove from the books or completely revise these archaic laws. The Telangana State Government will also review the laws and rules on its books and either remove or completely revise these archaic laws that are within the competence of the Telangana State Government.
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES
As per Section 94 (1) of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act 2014, the Central Government shall take appropriate fiscal measures, including offer of tax incentives, to the successor States, to promote industrialisation and economic growth in both the States.
• 100% central excise benefit for 5 (or more) years
The government will pass on these benefits to the entrepreneurs once they get notified by the Government of India.
INDUSTRIAL CORRIDORS
The presence of important national and state highways, coupled with the availability of resources and opportunities, provides a great potential for development of industrial corridors in the state along these roadways. The corridors will be modelled after Special Investment Zones like the DMIC or the PCPIR. While the available government lands will be utilised to spark industrial activities in the corridor, the privately held lands will also be regulated through special zoning regulations so that the desired growth of industries and support facilities can materialize.
The Industrial Corridors that will be developed initially will be:
1) Hyderabad-Warangal Industrial Corridor
In the second phase, the following industrial corridors will be developed.
1) Hyderabad-Mancherial Industrial Corridor
The Telangana State Government will take up the development of industrial corridors on roadways linking Hyderabad to Warangal on a priority basis. Subsequently, other corridors will also be identified on similar lines and detailed studies will be conducted to prepare the Master Plan for each corridor. Ultimately, each district headquarters of the State will be connected by high speed rail and road network.
The intention would be to create at least two core sector specific industrial parks for each sector. This will ensure that the benefits of industrialization will reach every district of the State, which will have 2 or more industrial parks. In addition, district wise industry potential plans at the MSME level will be prepared, utilizing the natural resources available in each district. These sector specific industrial parks will be located in the influence areas of the industrial corridors.
RESEARCH AND INNOVATION CIRCLE OF HYDERABAD (RICH)
Hyderabad is the home to a number of internationally- and nationally-reputed educational and research institutions. ICRISAT, CRIDA, CCMB, IICT, DRDL, NIPER, IIT, BITS, IIIT, ISB, UoH, OU, are some of them. The Government intends to harness the talent available in these institutions to the fullest to benefit the industrial sector by bringing new ideas, new innovations, new technologies, new products and services, to make the industries in Telangana globally competitive. The Government recognizes the present gaps in the innovation-entrepreneurship-investment ecosystem, which has prevented the full utilization of the research and development work taking place in these institutions. Government, therefore, intends to create a platform to be named Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad, or RICH in short, as a Section 25 Company that will link the research institutes, academia and industry along with Venture Capitalists, Angel Investors and Incubation Funds. Through this mechanism, innovation will be encouraged and commercialization of research will be promoted. The Government of Telangana will invest substantially in RICH so that it can become a self-sustaining organization. RICH will focus on the core industrial sectors outlined earlier in this Policy. To supplement RICH and encourage innovation and incubation, Telangana State Government will create a Research to Market Fund (RMF) to fund entrepreneurial activity, and provide a matching contribution up to Rs 100 crore to the Fund for amounts contributed by private venture capitalists and angel investors.
Linking up the technical educational institutions, technical education students and industry will also be taken up by RICH. RICH will create a model of strong industry-institution linkage that will ensure practical training for all technical graduates in industry, making them more employable immediately out of college.
SPECIFIC INITIATIVES FOR 2014-15
During the year 2014-15, in addition to the others mandates of the Policy Framework, the following specific initiatives will be implemented.
• New Pharma-City and Chemical City with well-developed infrastructure including waste management
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
As part of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) companies that have a turnover above a particular financial limits as prescribed by Government of India from time to time, are expected to spend a portion of their profits on activities that benefit the community at large. Usually, these companies have their own CSR Plans and in many cases the CSR Plans are formulated at their corporate headquarters that may not be located within the State of Telangana. In addition, individual amounts being spent by individual corporates may not be substantial to make significant impact in the local community. The Telangana State Government intends to coordinate with the industry groups to ensure that a systematic and comprehensive annual state-wide plan is created by all companies so that CSR in Telangana will have maximum impact.
SAFETY NET AND EXIT POLICY
Other than statutory provident fund type of instruments, there is no safety net for industrial workers. In the event of closure of an industry, many of the employees are likely to face a serious economic crisis. The Government of Telangana will explore the possibility of creating a safety net scheme with contribution of industry and Government to create a safety net for industrial workers.
Similarly, over the past few years, industry groups have been requesting Governments to craft an exit policy for industry. Once an industry is set up, there is no exit policy at present by which the interests of the investor, the employees and the financial institutions are protected. Though an industry exit policy is in the domain of the Central Government, the Government of Telangana will work closely with GOI in the formulation of an exit policy.
CONCLUSION
The new Industrial Policy brought out by the Government of Telangana promises to revolutionise the way industrial sector has been viewed by successive governments in this country. A day is not far when the new Industrial Policy of Telangana will shine as an exemplar among the best in the world. “Innovate in Telangana, Invest in Telangana, Incorporate in Telangana” will become the motto of industrialization in the new state. It is strongly believed that with the new Industrial Policy in place, a growth rate of 4-5% greater than the national growth rate in the Manufacturing Sector can be achieved.
The Telangana State Government welcomes industrialists, investors and entrepreneurs to this new state and promises to fulfill their expectations both in letter and in spirit as espoused in the new Industrial Policy.

2,400 Villages in Telangana to Have e-Panchayat Soon
HYDERABAD: In its grand plan to transform the newly-formed Telangana state into a role model in the implementation of e-governance initiatives, the state government is preparing strategies to take the administration to the door-step of people.
The government has proposed to start e-Panchayat initiative in 2,400 gram panchayats in the state. There are 8,778 panchayats in Telangana.
In order to implement the initiative in an effective manner a review meeting is being held under the chairmanship of panchayat raj and information technology minister K Taraka Rama Rao on Friday with top officials of the departments concerned. The minister is likely to make important suggestions and formulate guidelines at the meeting for successful implementation of e-panchayat.
Under the initiative, the state government proposes to provide computer services at the lowest level of government.
The government will set up ‘one-stop shops’ in these gram panchayats to facilitate payments relating to MGNREGS, pensions, watershed and other government programmes. The main aim of the initiative is to empower these GPs to be transparent, accountable and responsive.
The e-panchayat scheme is expected to bring about a revolution in increasing transparency and accountability in all the gram panchayats and make them function like a village-level secretariat. According to officials, e-panchayat is being aimed at equipping rural folk with comprehensive and updated information in panchayats and ensuring transparency in governance. Issue of birth and death certificates, house tax, pension schemes, SGRY development works and details of beneficiaries will be computerised. Data on gram panchayats could be easily obtained through internet.

CM Sri K.Chandrashekar Rao formally launched the Telangana State Industrial Policy 2015. Ministers Sri Jupally Krishna Rao, Sri Jagadish Reddy and Sri KT Rama Rao also participated in the event.
The Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self-Certification System (TS-iPASS) will be launched at 11 am at HICC on June 12.
Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao held a review with officials concerned on the launch of TS-iPASS at his camp office on Saturday. The TS-iPASS website will also be launched on the same day, the chief minister said adding that all the information will be available on the website. Nearly 2,500 industrialists are likely to attend the launch.
Rao reiterated that the land required for setting up of industries was available in plenty in the state. So far 60,000 acres of land was ready with the TSIIC, which will allot land to the industries.
All the basic amenities like water, roads and power would be provided by the state government for industries, Rao assured. “The industrial atmosphere in the state will be very friendly to industrialists. Plug and play system will be available for them,” Rao said. He also assured 24X7 uninterrupted power supply to industries.
There will be no shortage of water to the industrial sector since the government has already taken a decision to allot 10 per cent of water in every irrigation project to industries, the chief minister explained.
All the permissions required for new industries would be given within two weeks.The chief minister claimed that “Telangana Single Window without grills” slogan attracted the industrialists across the globe.
Later, the chief minister will tour a couple of countries to attract investments. To see more –

IT Minister K.T Rama Rao speaking after launching Amazon Fulfilment Centre at Kottur, Mahabubnagar dist.
Amazon, the global e-commerce and cloud services firm, is betting big on India. The firm, which announced investments of $2 billions to strengthen its presence in India, is lining up its biggest global campus outside of the US. It is also considering a proposal to set up a datacentre to back its cloud service business Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The company has opened its biggest Fulfilment Centre or warehouse near here, taking the total number of centres to 11 in eight States.
About 60 kilometres from Hyderabad and 25 kilometres from the international airport, the 2.80 lakh sq ft facility is going to help small and medium businesses (SMBs) utilise the logistics and delivery capabilities offered by Amazon.
Using automated solutions, the firm segregates and packages the goods before delivering them to customers.
How SMBs can join
The firm is in touch with SMBs to educate them about the advantages to piggyback on the web-enabled business opportunities.
Amazon India Director (Operations) Akhil Saxena said that the SMBs could bring their inventory here and use our shipping and delivery capabilities to reach out to vast customer base. “They don’t need to bother about investments on non-core aspects of their businesses,” he said.
SMBs can join using Self-Service option to register themselves. They can take a tip or two from about 79 YouTube videos in ‘Amazon Seller University’ on how to tap opportunities offered by the firm, Akhil said.
Amazon founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, who was in India last year, announced that it would invest $2 b in India as he saw huge potential here in e-commerce and SMBs.
Telangana IT Minister K Taraka Rama Rao, who recently visited Amazon headquarters in Seattle (the US) to sign the agreement with regard to the facility, inaugurated the facility. Addressing a gathering later, he said the firm had been allocated 10 acres of land at the IT hub Gachibowli for the proposed campus.See more –

Sat, 23 May 2015 04:50:10 +0000
http://www.it.telangana.gov.in/?p=2485
Hitachi Solutions India will open one more global development centre in Hyderabad this August, a facility crucial to achieving its plans to enhance engagement in the country and more than double the headcount.
On Saturday, a delegation of top executives, including Hitachi Solutions America president and global COO Mike Gillis and the Indian subsidiary’s CEO and managing director Ananth Subramanian, met Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and invited him to inaugurate the centre.
While agreeing to the request, Mr. Rao also evinced keen interest in the multiple smart card system solution of Hitachi. He was keen that such systems be taken beyond Hyderabad to locations such as Warangal, Khammam and Karimnagar.
The Chief Minister, a release issued by his office said, urged the team to explore possibilities of Hitachi setting up a heavy machinery plant in the State. Highlighting the investor-friendly measures and new industrial policy, he reiterated his government’s commitment to accord time-bound clearances.
Mr. Subramanian said the delegation conveyed Hitachi’s interest to work with the State government in the areas of smart city solutions, healthcare and education. One of the solutions was to improve “connect between the government and citizen and make services more effective”.
Hitachi Solutions India is a subsidiary of Hitachi Solutions America and provides industry solutions and services based on Microsoft Dynamics software. Stating that the number would increase to 500 in a little over a year, Mr. Subramanian said the existing development centre in Hyderabad was established in 2013. It was the first meeting of Hitachi executives with the Chief Minister and the discussions were to be taken forward with the government.
A senior executive from Hitachi Solutions America in the delegation told The Hindu that a solution built by Hitachi on Microsoft platform for public transportation in Auckland was showcased. Chhattisgarh, he added, had also expressed interest in the system comprising pre-paid cards for bus travel and devices to read them. The company executives also explained the possibility of introducing a card similar to Suica in Japan that could be used to pay for a range of services, from public transport, cabs to purchases from neighbourhood stores.
The Hitachi delegation also met Industries Minister Jupally Krishna Rao and briefed him about Hitachi Solutions’ specialising in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) development for industries, computerisation and modernisation of health services, use of modern gadgets with the help of IT in the security systems, e-governance and smart city concepts in administration, linking IT and transport sectors, skill development among students with the help of IT and IT-enabled supervision and controlling system in the textiles sector.
The delegation assured the Minister that they would prepare and submit a blueprint to the government based on its priorities and expressed interest in partnering developmental activities.
Industrial Policy Framework for State of Telangana (2014)
Fri, 27 Mar 2015 05:28:40 +0000
http://119.226.159.199/tgit/?p=1821
PREAMBLE
Industrialization will be the key strategy followed for economic growth and development for Telangana, the 29th state of the country. People of the new state have very high expectations from the Telangana State Government for creating jobs for the youth, promote development of backward areas, maximize growth opportunities by optimum utilization of the available resources, harness the talents and skills of the people, and usher prosperity in every household. Industrialization holds the potential for fulfilling all the dreams and aspirations of the people of Telangana.
The vision for industrialization of Telangana is “Research to Innovation; Innovation to Industry; Industry to Prosperity”. The industrial policy framework will be driven by the slogan of “In Telangana—Innovate, Incubate, Incorporate”. The policy framework intends to provide a business regulatory environment where doing business would be as easy as shaking hands. Innovation and technology will drive the industries of the Telangana State.
The Government of Telangana State realizes that industrial development requires large-scale private sector participation, with the government playing the role of a facilitator and a catalyst. The government is committed to provide a graft-free, hassle-free environment in which the entrepreneurial spirit of local, domestic and international investors will thrive to take up their industrial units in the state of Telangana as the preferred investment destination. The new Industrial Policy will be the instrument through which the vision of the Telangana State Government will be translated into action.
The new Telangana State Industrial Policy will be rooted in certain core values, as follows:
• The Government regulatory framework shall facilitate industrial growth
OBJECTIVES
The new Telangana State Industrial Policy will strive to provide a framework which will not only stabilize and make existing industries more competitive, but also attract and realize new international and national investments in the industrial sector. The focus will be on core manufacturing sectors, with the creation of employment for urban and rural youth and adding value to existing skills emphasised at all stages. It is expected that the most significant outcome of this approach will be the production of high quality goods at the most competitive price, which establishes “Made in Telangana-Made in India” as a brand with high global recognition.
The cornerstone of the policy would be zero graft and zero tolerance to corruption. The decision-making in all Telangana State Departments will be transparent and the departmental heads will held responsible for all acts of omission and commission by departmental staff. An online and help-desk grievance redressal system will be put in place where entrepreneur will be encouraged to report instances of corruption or any delays in performing timely tasks by Telangana State Government departments. Timely and strict disciplinary action will be taken against those employees who violate the parameters of the Industrial Policy Framework.
The Industrial Policy Framework has the following mandate for departments that have any responsibility in the industrialization of the State—Minimum Inspection and Maximum Facilitation.
Minimum inspection would encompass a system of no random inspections without cause. Subject to statutory requirements, the departments will develop a system where each industrial unit is inspected only once in 3/4 years and the cycle of inspections to be fixed in advance. Some random inspections will be planned to keep the industry also in its toes, but these inspections will be with the specific written permission of the head of the department.
Maximum Facilitation would encompass an effective system beyond the conventional single window as the anchor. Self-certification will be encouraged and automatic renewals will be implemented. There will be web based E-helpline facilities as well as physical help-desks at Hyderabad and Districts. Information availability and industry department transactions will be transparent and web enabled. The Office of the Commissioner of Industries and the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation will have a Citizens Charter covering all their activities.
EFFECTIVE SINGLE WINDOW MECHANISM
The Government of Telangana State is determined to create an ecosystem in which the ease of doing business in the state matches and even exceeds the best global standards. Telangana State Government is aware that offering a hassle-free system is considered to be of the highest priority by the industrialists, and accordingly the government will implement a very effective industrial clearance system that will go beyond the traditional single window system. This system, called the Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self-certification System (TS-iPASS), will be strengthened by way of legislation. A Right to Single Window Clearance, on the lines of the Right to Information, will be bestowed for all applicants. Penal action will be imposed on the concerned officers who delay the applications.
This will be at three levels—one for Mega Projects, one for other Large industries, and one for SMEs. The state government will bring out a comprehensive legislation enshrining the above principles for according permissions and clearances for both Mega Projects as well as industrial applications in other categories.
THRUST AREAS AND CORE SECTORS
The Telangana State Government has conducted detailed studies and consulted experts to identify the competitive advantages the state can have, given its geographical location, available resources and skill-base, raw material availability, existing manufacturing practices and expertise, and opening up of new opportunities. Accordingly, the Telangana State Government recognizes the following 14 sectors as thrust areas, investments in which will be accorded a higher priority over others.
Thrust Areas:
1 Life Sciences—including, bulk drugs, formulations,vaccines, nutraceuticals, biologicals, incubation centers, R&D facilities and medical equipment
Hyderabad is the bulk drug and vaccine capital of the country. However, in the past 8-10 years the sector has stagnated. While the leadership in formulations and bulk drugs has to be maintained, new opportunities like life-saving drugs, new vaccines and biologicals have emerged. There is an urgent need to encourage this sector, especially in the emerging life sciences areas.
2 IT Hardware including bio-medical devices, electronics, cellular communications, FAB
Telangana has a robust IT Software sector which will complement IT Hardware. The Government of India has approved and IT Investment Region for Hyderabad as well as two Electronic Manufacturing Clusters. The large health industry in Telangana will support bio-medical devices and medical electronics
3 Precision Engineering, including aviation, aerospace, defence
Hyderabad is home to a large number of defence aero-space and defence research laboratories like DRDO, DRDL, RCI, BDL, MDN, Ordnance Factory, DMRL etc. In addition to the 5 large Tata investments in aero-space, there is also the GMR MRO. A group of innovative aero-space SMEs also exist in Hyderabad which has supplied components to the Chandrayan and Mangalyan initiatives. GOI has also announced 49% FDI in defence sector creating huge investment opportunities.
4 Food processing and nutrition products including dairy, poultry, meat and fisheries
Telangana is a large producer of agro-products like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, fruits and spices. It is also the market leader in the poultry and seed business. There is potential expand into greenhouse and exotic vegetable cultivation. To add value to agro-products and to maintain and expand the existing strengths as well as to partner with the national Food Processing Mission, there is a need to encourage this sector.
5 Automobiles, Transport Vehicles, Auto-components, Tractors and Farm Equipment
The automobile industry is an important sector for any State. The upstream and downstream supplier opportunities will boost the engineering SME sector also. The M&M tractor plant in Telangana and the auto-component SMEs will be the anchor around which the future growth and investments in the automobile sector will emerge
6 Textiles and Apparel, Leather and leather value added products like shoes, purses, bags, artificial material infused and coated textiles, paper and paper products
Telangana is a large producer of long staple cotton. It also is one of the largest producers of raw hide. However, value added production is not there within the State and raw material is exported from the State. The State has a strong base of paper industry. There is tremendous potential for paper and paper products industry in the state due to the growing demand for such products.
7 Plastics and Polymers, Chemicals and Petro-chemical, glass and ceramics
The former combined state of Andhra Pradesh had a PCPIR sanctioned by the GOI. This has gone to the residual State. Plastics, polymers and downstream petro-chemical industry are predominantly in the MSME sector with huge employment potential. The products of this sector are consumed on a daily basis all over the country. This sector is critical for a large number of MSMEs
8 FMCG and Domestic Appliances
The growth rates of the Fast Moving Consumer Goods and Domestic Appliances sector has been phenomenal, even when the country’s economy was slow. Telangana is centrally located in India and for the FMCG and Domestic appliances sectors, transportation costs are very critical. It is important to take advantage of the locational advantage of the state especially for this sector.
9 Engineering and Capital Goods, including castings, foundry and Ferro-alloys and other metallurgical industries
This sector is very important if the State has to capture the entire value chain of the automobile, aero-space, petro-chemicals, domestic appliances, and paper and textile sectors. The thrust areas in this section will provide the supply chain to the other thrust area sectors.
10 Gems and Jewellery
Hyderabadi pearls and lacquer bangles made by local artisans are known all over the world. Value-addition to these traditional products and diversification into other gems and jewellery items will provide the much needed relief to local artisans and craftsmen.
11 Waste Management and Green Technologies
This is the sector that will become mandatory for all industry. Green initiatives can be shown to be profitable. The Telangana State has functional models of SPV/JV efforts of waste management. This sector has tremendous growth potential.
12 Renewable Energy and Solar Parks
This sector is a priority all over the world. The State of Telangana has large extents of land eminently suitable for non-conventional and renewable energy installations
13 Mineral-based and wood-based Industries
Much of the minor mineral wealth of the State like granite, quartz and silica-sand is exported in raw form with minimal processing within the State. Similarly, bamboo and other MDF-suitable plant material also need to be exploited so that sustainable incomes are generated and the regular the forests trees can be saved.
14 Transportation/Logistic Hub/Inland Port/Container Depot
The State of Telangana is land-locked; yet it hopes to become a major destination for international investors. In addition it is centrally located and has the potential to become a major transit and logistic hub.
Each of the above thrust areas will have its own sectoral policy and a structure of incentives. High level advisory panels with private sector and academia experts will be constituted for each of the sectors. An inter-departmental task force for each sector chaired by Special Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary of Industries and Commerce Department will also be in place to achieve the required coordination. Frequent thrust area sector-centric investor meets will be organised to showcase the advantages the state of Telangana offers for that sector. Thrust area sector-centric industrial parks with well-developed infrastructure required for that particular sector will be developed at appropriate locations in the state.
CLASSIFICATION OF PROJECTS
The classification of projects into large, medium, small and micro sectors will be based on the Government of India MSME Ministry definitions as amended from time to time. The definition of a mega project is a Telangana State determined one. Government of India has proposed to raise the investment limits under each category and the classification for now is as follows.
• Mega Projects : Those having investment of above Rs. 200 crores in plant and machinery or providing employment tomore than 1000 persons
SPECIAL FOCUS ON SMEs/MICRO INDUSTRIES
The SMEs and Micro-industries are expected to play a significant role in the new state of Telangana, both in terms of value addition and also in creating employment opportunities. The new Telangana State Industrial Policy will make special provisions for the SME and Micro sectors, as follows:
• Adequate number of smaller plots in Industrial parks for SMEs; developed sheds for Micro units
ANCILLARY/VENDOR DEVELOPMENT
Within each of the core sectors, Telangana State Government is interested in the promotion of the ecosystem covering the entire value chain. An important component of the value chain is the primary suppliers who provide the raw material or the component parts to the anchor manufacturing industry, or provide basic inputs to a service industry. The Telangana State Government will plan each Industrial park in such a way that along with anchor units, enough plots are available for setting up Suppliers/Vendors Park. Since the ancillary units are usually in the SME category, these plots will be smaller in size. Mega projects will have to compulsorily set up a Suppliers/Vendors park to encourage growth of local ancillaries.
PREVENTING INCIPIENT SICKNESS AMONG SMEs
The Telangana State Government intends to create a corpus fund jointly with the industries and their associations which will act as a safety net for SMEs that face any crisis and run the risk of imminent sickness. Telangana State Government will also work closely with the RBI constituted State Level Inter-Institutional Committee (SLIIC) to coordinate revival plans of sick and incipient SMEs.
SPECIAL ASSISTANCE TO WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS
Like SC/ST entrepreneurs, the number of existing women-owned industrial enterprises is very meagre. The Telangana State Government will encourage women entrepreneurs in a big way. Each of the 9 districts of the state (excluding Hyderabad) will have one or more industrial parks exclusively for women. Organizations working for women entrepreneurs like COWE, ALEAP and FICCI-FLO will be invited to partner with the government to identify and train women entrepreneurs, get their project proposals developed, link them to financial institutions and handhold and monitor the progress of their projects. Among women, the government would facilitate more number of entrepreneurs to emerge from socially deprived categories like SCs, STs, BCs and Minorities.
SPECIAL SUPPORT FOR SC/ST ENTREPRENEURS
It is an unfortunate reality that a very minuscule proportion of existing industrial units are owned by SC/ST entrepreneurs. There are a number of structural barriers which the SC/ST entrepreneurs find extremely difficult to overcome. Since the foundation of the new state of Telangana is based on the premise of social justice, the new Telangana State Industrial Policy will take up a number of additional support measures meant to increase entrepreneurship among the SCs/STs. This program will be implemented under the banner of TS-PRIDE—Telangana State Program for Rapid Incubation of Dalit Entrepreneurs and some of these initiatives under T-PRIDE are as follows:
• A special direct funding program for financing SC/ST entrepreneurs will be worked out to utilize the money available under the respective Sub-Plans.
TRADITIONAL ARTS AND HANDICRAFTS
The State of Telangana has a number of internationally recognized forms of traditional arts and handicrafts. These are handicrafts like Nirmal Paintings, Dokra metal work, Bidri ware, Pembarthy Brass ware as well as textiles like Pochampally Ikat, Gadwal saris and Warangal carpets. A number of artisans and craft-persons continue to live on the production of these arts and handicrafts, but there income levels are declining. To improve the productivity and incomes in this sector, the Government of Telangana intends to take a number of actions, including:
• Identification and documentation of arts and crafts
This program will be implemented under the T-HART—Telangana State Handicrafts and Artisans Revival with Technology program.
MARKETING BRAND TELANGANA
Telangana is the 29th and newest State of the Union of India. There is a need to create awareness about the State of Telangana and its brand image. To this end, Telangana State will participate extensively in a large number of national and international trade fairs, conferences and exhibitions so that the strengths and opportunities of the State can be show-cased. The industrial policy of Telangana State has also to be publicised widely. In addition to promoting the brand image of the state, it is also essential to promote the SMEs of the state. The State will actively promote the participation of Telangana SMEs in trade fairs, expositions, buyer seller meets and other such events. The State will also leverage all funds available from Government of India schemes under the MSME, Commerce, Textiles, and Pharmaceutical Departments and sector specific Export Promotion Councils to promote State SMEs. Adequate budget support will be provided for marketing the State and the industrial and craft products of the State.
INDUSTRIAL LAND BANK
It is estimated that about 20 lakh acres of land is available in the state that has been identified as unfit for cultivation in Telangana. Based on a detailed survey of these land parcels and identification of those parcels that are fit for industrial use, an industrial land bank for the State of Telangana will be developed. Such lands would be transferred to the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC). Once the lands so identified are transferred to the TSIIC, the TSIIC will determine the suitability of each land parcel for setting up core sector specific Industrial Parks. The core sectors are those sectors listed earlier in the new Industrial Policy.Exclusive industrial parks in safe zones will also be created for setting up of red category industries. Some of the industrial parks will also permit multi-sectoral activities and general manufacturing units.
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
The development of industrial and related infrastructure will be the responsibility of the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC). The financial base of the TSIIC will be strengthened and it will be made to function as an effective organization. All lands in the State identified as fit for industrial use will be transferred to the TSIIC. This land asset base will be leveraged to raise finances from the market so that the TSIIC can become independent of Government over a period of time as far as budgetary support is concerned.
The TSIIC will develop all required infrastructure for the sector specific parks like approach roads, water supply, industrial power, and common effluent treatment facilities. TSIIC will raise market loans with Government guarantee and also get initial minimal budgetary support for the creation of the infrastructure in these new industrial parks. It will be ensured that at the time of allotment to industries, all infrastructure facilities are available in the industrial park, and the investor can begin the construction of his unit right from day 1.
CONNECTIVITY
Approach roads of suitable dimension, keeping in mind the nature of industrial activity likely to happen within the park, will be developed to provide connectivity to the nearest national/state highway, railway station and airport. Based on requirement, provision of a railway siding will also be considered.
INDUSTRIAL WATER
To support industrialization, the Government of Telangana will earmark 10% of water from all existing and new irrigation sources for industrial use. Water pipelines will be laid as a part of infrastructure creation for each industrial park by TSIIC. The TSIIC will coordinate with the appropriate department that is responsible for the creation of the Telangana Water Grid so that industrial water for local MSMEs is made available through the Grid.
INDUSTRIAL POWER
The Government of Telangana State recognizes that quality power and uninterrupted power supply are keys to the growth of the industrial sector. The State has a clear short-, medium-, and long-term plans to first overcome the power shortage and eventually become a power surplus state. Accordingly, uninterrupted power supply will be arranged in each industrial park. The government will also explore the possibility of creating a separate DISCOM exclusively for the industrial parks. Further, “open access” power restrictions will be removed as far as possible to enable all types of industries, including MSMEs to be able to access the power exchange.
The Telangana State Government will encourage usage of non-conventional energy for industrial purposes. Both the user industry and the non-conventional energy suppliers will be provided appropriate incentives to encourage investments in non-conventional energy projects, especially solar power.
In large industrial parks, the Government will facilitate setting up of Private Merchant Power Plants. These 300-500 MW power plants will be —interest from Chinese and Singapore based investors dedicated to group of industrial parks and the tariff could be negotiated between industry users and the producer. The Telangana State TRANSCO will facilitate wheeling and transmission.
COMMON EFFLUENT TREATMENT PLANT (CETP)
Every industrial park will be provided with a common effluent treatment plant, depending of the nature of effluents expected from the specified industrial activity. The Telangana State Government will also encourage development of CETP through a Joint Venture/PPP model, since it is possible to operate and maintain a CETP on commercial lines.
INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE
On similar lines, the entire internal infrastructure within an industrial park like internal roads, water distribution lines, drains, waste disposal facilities, etc, will be developed by the TSIIC before lands are allotted to the industrial units.
STATUTORY CLEARANCES FOR THE INDUSTRIAL PARKS
It will be the responsibility of TSIIC to obtain all basic statutory clearances for these Industrial Parks from the appropriate authorities like Land Conversion, Land Use, Layout approval and Environmental Clearance from Ministry of Environment & Forests, Government of India so that the industrial units need not obtain individual clearances.
LAND ALLOTMENT PROCESS
Details of all land parcels that form part of the industrial land bank of
Three empowered bodies will manage the land allotment process in a transparent and objective manner. The State Industrial Promotion Committee (SIPC) headed by the Chief Secretary and including Special Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries/Secretaries from related line departments will finalise land allotment for Mega Projects. A State Level Allotment Committee (SLAC) headed by Managing Director, TSIIC will clear allotments for other Large Projects. All cases of Micro and SME applicants will be handled by the District Industrial Promotion Committee (DIPC) headed by the respective District Collector. Joint Collector will be the Vice-Chairman of the DIPC.
The process of application will be simplified and made web-enabled. All documents required for making application will be available on the website. An On-line application system will be followed, including the facility to upload all documents online. Facility will be available to the applicant to seek any clarification online. In addition, physical Help Desks will also be set up in the Head offices and all the District offices. The above Committees will meet frequently, and strict timelines for allotment according to Citizen’s Charter will be adhered to.
A mechanism will be put in place to realistically assess the actual requirement of land by each applicant. Empanelled technical experts will scrutinise the Detailed Project Report, and based on standard norms for each line of activity, will recommend the actual extent that can be allotted to the applicant. The recommendations of the technical experts will be used by the Committees for finalising land allotment to the applicant.
While making the allotment, the applicant will be required to submit a detailed implementation plan with clear milestones and timelines. The allottee will be held strictly accountable for the progress of his project as per the implementation plan. In case of any wilful default, the allotment will be cancelled and land resumed.
Once the allotment is finalised by the relevant Committee, the applicant will be required to enter into an “Agreement to Sale” with the TSIIC. This will allow him to raise financing by mortgaging the land for project development. However, the title over the land will be conferred through a “Sale Deed” only when the project is completed and commercial production has started. During the construction and project development stage, the original promoter will not be permitted to dilute his equity beyond 51% in the project. “Agreement to Sale” will be cancelled in case any willful default as mentioned above is observed.
Other than the outright sale method of land allotment, allotment of land on long-term lease to the SMEs will also be considered, particularly when no costs have been incurred by the TSIIC in land procurement.
COMMON FACILITY CENTRES AND UTILITY CENTERS
Every Industrial Park will have some number of plots earmarked for Common Facilities like Electricity sub-stations, Police Outposts, Fire stations, e-seva centres, Banks, Petrol stations, Canteens, local shopping, etc. These will be allotted to concerned government agencies or private parties in an objective and transparent manner by following defined criterion.
The Government will also encourage setting up of Utility Centers with the involvement of the private sector. These utility centers will provide dedicated power, water, steam, waste management facilities and other industrial inputs to designated specific or a group of industrial parks. There will be direct and independent contracts between the Utility Center Company and the individual industries in the designated industrial parks.
LAND PRICING
A Price Fixation Committee (PFC) constituted within TSIIC will determine the prices of all the land parcels in different industrial parks by following an objective criterion. The final price will be the aggregate of the prevailing land price in that area as ascertained from the Registration records, the cost incurred in land development and infrastructure creation, and a nominal administrative charge. The land prices will also be displayed on the website, along with other information. The land price will have validity for a specified time period, and will get revised periodically. A separate pricing mechanism will be followed for the plots earmarked for Common Facilities. Land for location of industry will be available on outright purchase/sale or on a lease basis.
LAND ACQUISITION FOR INDUSTRIES
In case none of the land parcels available in the industrial land bank of the government are found suitable by an applicant, and if he prefers a privately owned land, it is possible for the TSIIC to acquire it on his behalf by following the provisions of the prevailing Land Acquisition Act.
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT ON PRIVATE LANDS
Industry will be encouraged in private lands designated for industrial use in spatial planning of HMDA and other urban development authorities in Telangana. Private industrial park developers will be encouraged to pool their lands so that good quality infrastructure can be developed in the TSIIC standards. In case an industry has to be set up in private lands other than that zoned as industrial, Government of Telangana will do its best to change the land use pattern if such conversion is not prohibited by the spatial planning of the area.
SKILL DEVELOPMENT
While encouraging industrial investments on one hand, the Telangana State Government realizes that an important responsibility laid on its shoulders is to make trained and skilled manpower available for the industry’s requirements. The Telangana State Government will accordingly take up appropriate skill development programmes so that technically qualified youth can find employment in industry. These skill development programs have to be industry sector specific and the training package has to be developed in consultation with the industry so that the trained candidates meet industry requirements. Telangana State Government will take support of accredited private sector skill providers in this endeavour. Mega industries will also be especially encouraged to start their own skill development centres within the same industrial park where their unit is located. The Industrial Area Societies will also be encouraged to participate in design and implementing skill development programs.
Skill development programmes would aim to train the youth in getting entry-level jobs, and also upgradation of skills of the existing employees. The skill development programmes targeted at industrial sector jobs will be supported by the government under the ambit of the Telangana State’s Skill Development Mission in general and the Telangana State Accelerated SSI Skills Training (T-ASSIST) program of the Industries and Commerce Department.
INDUSTRIAL TOWNSHIPS
As part of the master plan for the sector specific industrial parks to be developed by TSIIC, provision for mini-industrial townships will be made. The townships will contain executive housing, workers housing, social infrastructure and other amenities. This township development can be initiated by the TSIIC in partnership with established industry groups who have the competence in this field and also other reputed real estate companies. Further, in the vicinity of industrial parks, lands will be zoned as Residential, to enable the private sector to also develop housing for the industrial employees. Separate norms and incentives for the township development will be released as a part of state’s urban development policy.
INDUSTRIAL AREA LOCAL AUTHORITY
As a part of providing a hassle-free environment for the industrial units, the concept of Industrial Area Local Authority (IALA) will be strengthened. All new industrial parks that will be set up by the TSIIC will be covered under the IALA system. All existing TSIIC Industrial Parks which do not have an IALA will adopt the IALA system. This will enable industries to get faster clearances required for starting of construction since the IALA will take advance clearances. The IALA will play an important role in monitoring the compliance of the Industry with self-certified local and national laws and Acts.
INDUSTRIAL INCENTIVES
The Telangana State Government is committed to encourage the process of industrialization by making various kinds of incentives available to the entrepreneurs. The Telangana State Government also assures an entrepreneur-friendly and graft-free regime of disbursing the incentives. The Telangana State Government guarantees that the incentives will be released on time, and direct to the bank account. There will be a transparent on-line application system, with minimum human interface.
There will be enhanced incentive packages for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled tribes, Physically Handicapped, and women entrepreneurs. Mega Projects with an investment of over Rs. 200 crores in plant and machinery or employment above 1000 persons will receive tailor-made incentives in addition to standard largecategory industry incentives.
The Telangana State Government will consider providing incentives to the entrepreneurs in the following areas under its T-IDEA (Telangana State Industrial Development and Entrepreneur Advancement) incentive scheme:
a. Stamp duty reimbursement
Details of general and sector-specific incentives will be issued through Government Orders from time to time and publicized on the website and through other means. While providing incentives to future industries, the Government will also ensure that the existing industries are also benefited.
RATIONALIZATION OF TAXES
A sound industrial policy has to ensure that the state taxation structure is conducive to industrial growth and state financial resource augmentation. Distortions in the tax structure leads to evasion of taxes and clandestine transport of industrial inputs and outputs to neighbouring states, which may have advantageous tax rates. To address this problem, inter-state tax rationalization on industrial inputs and outputs with neighbouring states like Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu will be brought out within a short span of time.
REVIEW OF ALL LAWS IMPACTING INDUSTRY
It is common knowledge that a number of laws and rules that impact industry and industrialization are outdated. For example, the Indian Boilers Act is of 1923 and the Indian Boilers Rules is from the year 1950. The Indian Factories Act is from the year 1948. The Electrical Inspector implements the provisions of the Indian Electricity Rules 1956. The Government of India has also announced its intention to review all legislation and either remove from the books or completely revise these archaic laws. The Telangana State Government will also review the laws and rules on its books and either remove or completely revise these archaic laws that are within the competence of the Telangana State Government.
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES
As per Section 94 (1) of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act 2014, the Central Government shall take appropriate fiscal measures, including offer of tax incentives, to the successor States, to promote industrialisation and economic growth in both the States.
• 100% central excise benefit for 5 (or more) years
The government will pass on these benefits to the entrepreneurs once they get notified by the Government of India.
INDUSTRIAL CORRIDORS
The presence of important national and state highways, coupled with the availability of resources and opportunities, provides a great potential for development of industrial corridors in the state along these roadways. The corridors will be modelled after Special Investment Zones like the DMIC or the PCPIR. While the available government lands will be utilised to spark industrial activities in the corridor, the privately held lands will also be regulated through special zoning regulations so that the desired growth of industries and support facilities can materialize.
The Industrial Corridors that will be developed initially will be:
1) Hyderabad-Warangal Industrial Corridor
In the second phase, the following industrial corridors will be developed.
1) Hyderabad-Mancherial Industrial Corridor
The Telangana State Government will take up the development of industrial corridors on roadways linking Hyderabad to Warangal on a priority basis. Subsequently, other corridors will also be identified on similar lines and detailed studies will be conducted to prepare the Master Plan for each corridor. Ultimately, each district headquarters of the State will be connected by high speed rail and road network.
The intention would be to create at least two core sector specific industrial parks for each sector. This will ensure that the benefits of industrialization will reach every district of the State, which will have 2 or more industrial parks. In addition, district wise industry potential plans at the MSME level will be prepared, utilizing the natural resources available in each district. These sector specific industrial parks will be located in the influence areas of the industrial corridors.
RESEARCH AND INNOVATION CIRCLE OF HYDERABAD (RICH)
Hyderabad is the home to a number of internationally- and nationally-reputed educational and research institutions. ICRISAT, CRIDA, CCMB, IICT, DRDL, NIPER, IIT, BITS, IIIT, ISB, UoH, OU, are some of them. The Government intends to harness the talent available in these institutions to the fullest to benefit the industrial sector by bringing new ideas, new innovations, new technologies, new products and services, to make the industries in Telangana globally competitive. The Government recognizes the present gaps in the innovation-entrepreneurship-investment ecosystem, which has prevented the full utilization of the research and development work taking place in these institutions. Government, therefore, intends to create a platform to be named Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad, or RICH in short, as a Section 25 Company that will link the research institutes, academia and industry along with Venture Capitalists, Angel Investors and Incubation Funds. Through this mechanism, innovation will be encouraged and commercialization of research will be promoted. The Government of Telangana will invest substantially in RICH so that it can become a self-sustaining organization. RICH will focus on the core industrial sectors outlined earlier in this Policy. To supplement RICH and encourage innovation and incubation, Telangana State Government will create a Research to Market Fund (RMF) to fund entrepreneurial activity, and provide a matching contribution up to Rs 100 crore to the Fund for amounts contributed by private venture capitalists and angel investors.
Linking up the technical educational institutions, technical education students and industry will also be taken up by RICH. RICH will create a model of strong industry-institution linkage that will ensure practical training for all technical graduates in industry, making them more employable immediately out of college.
SPECIFIC INITIATIVES FOR 2014-15
During the year 2014-15, in addition to the others mandates of the Policy Framework, the following specific initiatives will be implemented.
• New Pharma-City and Chemical City with well-developed infrastructure including waste management
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
As part of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) companies that have a turnover above a particular financial limits as prescribed by Government of India from time to time, are expected to spend a portion of their profits on activities that benefit the community at large. Usually, these companies have their own CSR Plans and in many cases the CSR Plans are formulated at their corporate headquarters that may not be located within the State of Telangana. In addition, individual amounts being spent by individual corporates may not be substantial to make significant impact in the local community. The Telangana State Government intends to coordinate with the industry groups to ensure that a systematic and comprehensive annual state-wide plan is created by all companies so that CSR in Telangana will have maximum impact.
SAFETY NET AND EXIT POLICY
Other than statutory provident fund type of instruments, there is no safety net for industrial workers. In the event of closure of an industry, many of the employees are likely to face a serious economic crisis. The Government of Telangana will explore the possibility of creating a safety net scheme with contribution of industry and Government to create a safety net for industrial workers.
Similarly, over the past few years, industry groups have been requesting Governments to craft an exit policy for industry. Once an industry is set up, there is no exit policy at present by which the interests of the investor, the employees and the financial institutions are protected. Though an industry exit policy is in the domain of the Central Government, the Government of Telangana will work closely with GOI in the formulation of an exit policy.
CONCLUSION
The new Industrial Policy brought out by the Government of Telangana promises to revolutionise the way industrial sector has been viewed by successive governments in this country. A day is not far when the new Industrial Policy of Telangana will shine as an exemplar among the best in the world. “Innovate in Telangana, Invest in Telangana, Incorporate in Telangana” will become the motto of industrialization in the new state. It is strongly believed that with the new Industrial Policy in place, a growth rate of 4-5% greater than the national growth rate in the Manufacturing Sector can be achieved.
The Telangana State Government welcomes industrialists, investors and entrepreneurs to this new state and promises to fulfill their expectations both in letter and in spirit as espoused in the new Industrial Policy.
Telangana releases Rs 90 crore for infrastructure project

The Centre has issued notification for the much-awaited ITIR project and the state government has released Rs 90 crore to fast track the project, which is set to increase the city’s infrastructure and investment profile.
The project is expected to attract a total investment of about Rs 2,19,440 crore of which the IT/ITeS sector is expected to attract Rs 1,18,355 crore and the electronic hardware manufacturing sector Rs 1,01,085 crore.
“The notification for ITIR Hyderabad has been issued and now it’s for the state government to take it forward,” said a senior official from the ministry of communication and information technology, New Delhi.
The Telangana state government, meanwhile, has a consultant appointed by the HMDA in place to work out detailed plans for the ITIR project. Around 41,000 acres of land is available in the vicinity of Hyderabad in three clusters for the project. The project requires nearly 50,000 acres of land.
The proposed ITIR is expected to have a lot of linkages with the existing IT/ITeS/EHM base in the state. Major players in the IT/ITeS sector, such as Google, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, Infosys, Wipro, Honeywell, Cognizant, TCS, HSBC, Dell, Amazon, Bank of America, Motorola, No-kia Siemens Network, Qual-comm, etc. and EHM companies like Solar Semi conductors,
MIC Electronics, Lampex Electronics, Titan Energy Systems, Embedded IT Solutions India Pvt Ltd, Photon Energy Systemsetc. have shown interest to move to the Brownfield area of ITIR.
Out of the proposed 202 sq. km area of ITIR, 41 per cent, i.e. 82.4 sq. km, would be the processing area (IT office space). Of this, the Greenfield area proposed for development through ITIR is 76.9 sq. km. The Brownfield area of 5.5 sq. km comprises existing IT developments in Madhapur, Gachibowli and Nanakramguda.
Hyderabad IT industry poised to reach $50 bn by 2025
Fri, 21 Nov 2014 11:25:15 +0000
http://10.3.3.91/tgit/?p=1831
The Information Technology industry in Hyderabad is poised to grow to $50 billion by 2025, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) said Friday.
The apex industry body turned 25, and to mark the occasion an event was held here Friday night to highlight the evolution of Hyderabad as a key destination for IT services and software in India.
Nasscom vice chairman B.V.R. Mohan Reddy said Nasscom’s contribution in changing the face of the industry was unparalleled.
He said that over the last 25 years, the IT sector grew to become a $120 billion industry in the country.
He said Nasscom’s Hyderabad membership was an important constituent in this accelerated journey.
Since the establishment of the industry in Hyderabad in 1992, the services and products domain here has grown exponentially in terms of both revenue and talent.
From a modest 40,000 square feet Software Technology Park (STP) shared by multiple companies, the sector now boasts of 1,000 acres of land and multinational IT giants.
The IT exports from Hyderabad currently are to the tune of $10 billion.
According to a recent report by Nasscom, over 200 startups have been set up in Hyderabad since 2010 focusing on big data, enterprise solutions and social media.
The region has received immense support from the state government and has rightly earned the name of ‘Cyberabad’ due to the sheer number of IT companies concentrated in the city.
Nasscom will continue to engage with large enterprises, SMEs and entrepreneurs in the city and across the country to evangelize the industry and support it to take the next big leap in the technology revolution, said a statement by the industry body.
It envisions the next 25 years as a journey driven by innovation, ambition and opportunities, which will see unprecedented growth across verticals.

Launching Amazon Fulfilment Centre
IT Minister K.T Rama Rao speaking after launching Amazon Fulfilment Centre at Kottur, Mahabubnagar dist.
Amazon, the global e-commerce and cloud services firm, is betting big on India. The firm, which announced investments of $2 billions to strengthen its presence in India, is lining up its biggest global campus outside of the US. It is also considering a proposal to set up a datacentre to back its cloud service business Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The company has opened its biggest Fulfilment Centre or warehouse near here, taking the total number of centres to 11 in eight States.
About 60 kilometres from Hyderabad and 25 kilometres from the international airport, the 2.80 lakh sq ft facility is going to help small and medium businesses (SMBs) utilise the logistics and delivery capabilities offered by Amazon.
Using automated solutions, the firm segregates and packages the goods before delivering them to customers.
How SMBs can join
The firm is in touch with SMBs to educate them about the advantages to piggyback on the web-enabled business opportunities.
Amazon India Director (Operations) Akhil Saxena said that the SMBs could bring their inventory here and use our shipping and delivery capabilities to reach out to vast customer base. “They don’t need to bother about investments on non-core aspects of their businesses,” he said.
SMBs can join using Self-Service option to register themselves. They can take a tip or two from about 79 YouTube videos in ‘Amazon Seller University’ on how to tap opportunities offered by the firm, Akhil said.
Amazon founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, who was in India last year, announced that it would invest $2 b in India as he saw huge potential here in e-commerce and SMBs.
Telangana IT Minister K Taraka Rama Rao, who recently visited Amazon headquarters in Seattle (the US) to sign the agreement with regard to the facility, inaugurated the facility. Addressing a gathering later, he said the firm had been allocated 10 acres of land at the IT hub Gachibowli for the proposed campus.See more –

Hitachi Solutions to open additional facility in Hyderabad
Hitachi Solutions India will open one more global development centre in Hyderabad this August, a facility crucial to achieving its plans to enhance engagement in the country and more than double the headcount.
On Saturday, a delegation of top executives, including Hitachi Solutions America president and global COO Mike Gillis and the Indian subsidiary’s CEO and managing director Ananth Subramanian, met Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and invited him to inaugurate the centre.
While agreeing to the request, Mr. Rao also evinced keen interest in the multiple smart card system solution of Hitachi. He was keen that such systems be taken beyond Hyderabad to locations such as Warangal, Khammam and Karimnagar.
The Chief Minister, a release issued by his office said, urged the team to explore possibilities of Hitachi setting up a heavy machinery plant in the State. Highlighting the investor-friendly measures and new industrial policy, he reiterated his government’s commitment to accord time-bound clearances.
Mr. Subramanian said the delegation conveyed Hitachi’s interest to work with the State government in the areas of smart city solutions, healthcare and education. One of the solutions was to improve “connect between the government and citizen and make services more effective”.
Hitachi Solutions India is a subsidiary of Hitachi Solutions America and provides industry solutions and services based on Microsoft Dynamics software. Stating that the number would increase to 500 in a little over a year, Mr. Subramanian said the existing development centre in Hyderabad was established in 2013. It was the first meeting of Hitachi executives with the Chief Minister and the discussions were to be taken forward with the government.
A senior executive from Hitachi Solutions America in the delegation told The Hindu that a solution built by Hitachi on Microsoft platform for public transportation in Auckland was showcased. Chhattisgarh, he added, had also expressed interest in the system comprising pre-paid cards for bus travel and devices to read them. The company executives also explained the possibility of introducing a card similar to Suica in Japan that could be used to pay for a range of services, from public transport, cabs to purchases from neighbourhood stores.
The Hitachi delegation also met Industries Minister Jupally Krishna Rao and briefed him about Hitachi Solutions’ specialising in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) development for industries, computerisation and modernisation of health services, use of modern gadgets with the help of IT in the security systems, e-governance and smart city concepts in administration, linking IT and transport sectors, skill development among students with the help of IT and IT-enabled supervision and controlling system in the textiles sector.
The delegation assured the Minister that they would prepare and submit a blueprint to the government based on its priorities and expressed interest in partnering developmental activities.
