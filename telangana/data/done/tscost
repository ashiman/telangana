Dear Esteemed Visitor,
At the outset, I must inform you that the Government of Telangana has been according priority for the development of Science, Technology and Innovation, ever since the formation of new state on 2nd June 2014. The Government of Telangana established the Telangana State Council of Science & Technology (TSCOST) and constituted the apex bodies of the council such as State Council and Executive Committee.
The much awaited Inauguration of the Regional Science Centre, an iconic structure for science promotion, was performed and the centre was declared open to the Public by none other than the Hon’ble Deputy Chief Minister of the State, Sri Kadiyam Srihari garu on 21st October 2015. At present, 69 scientific exhibits, drawn from the National Council of Science Museums (NCSM), Govt. of India, are housed in the Centre.  Edu-Sat Satellite Interactive Terminal (Edu-Sat SIT),  established at this centre with the support of Vigyan Prasar, New Delhi, provides two-way interactive communication between the scientists and students on a number of scientific topics. Students, Teachers and General Public are welcome to this centre. The Centre is open on all the State Government working days except that the weekly holiday for the Centre is Monday instead of Sunday.
TSCOST looks forward to strengthen the base of Science & Technology in all relevant sectors with support from the Ministry of Science & Technology, other Scientific Ministries of Govt. of India as well as the CSIR, ICAR, ICMR research institutes and other scientific bodies/ institutions.
Towards this, TSCOST desires to build strong alliances with Scientific & Academic community at State, National and International levels and across varied disciplines in its endeavour to create a strong base for development of scientific thinking with emphasis on application of scientific principles and interventions to solve location specific problems.
TSCOST has been treading on a visionary approach in spreading Science & Technology across the State with a view to align the people and society to reap the benefits of Research and Development undertaken by the vast resource pool of Scientists working in Scientific establishments.
Remarkable and unprecedented successes in the field of Science & Technology posted by our great Scientists made our Country India much stronger and self reliant in every field. We owe them a lot and should take the inspiration from such stalwarts of Indian Science to move forward.
I would earnestly request the eminent scientific and academic personalities to join hands with TSCOST for utilization of science, technology and innovation to alleviate location specific problems and to transform Telangana into a vibrant science-driven society.
Thanking you,

Telangana State Council of science & Technology

Member Secretary
Dear Esteemed Visitor,
At the outset, I must inform you that the Government of Telangana has been according priority for the development of Science, Technology and Innovation, ever since the formation of new state on 2nd June 2014. The Government of Telangana established the Telangana State Council of Science & Technology (TSCOST) and constituted the apex bodies of the council such as State Council and Executive Committee.
The much awaited Inauguration of the Regional Science Centre, an iconic structure for science promotion, was performed and the centre was declared open to the Public by none other than the Hon’ble Deputy Chief Minister of the State, Sri Kadiyam Srihari garu on 21st October 2015. At present, 69 scientific exhibits, drawn from the National Council of Science Museums (NCSM), Govt. of India, are housed in the Centre.  Edu-Sat Satellite Interactive Terminal (Edu-Sat SIT),  established at this centre with the support of Vigyan Prasar, New Delhi, provides two-way interactive communication between the scientists and students on a number of scientific topics. Students, Teachers and General Public are welcome to this centre. The Centre is open on all the State Government working days except that the weekly holiday for the Centre is Monday instead of Sunday.
TSCOST looks forward to strengthen the base of Science & Technology in all relevant sectors with support from the Ministry of Science & Technology, other Scientific Ministries of Govt. of India as well as the CSIR, ICAR, ICMR research institutes and other scientific bodies/ institutions.
Towards this, TSCOST desires to build strong alliances with Scientific & Academic community at State, National and International levels and across varied disciplines in its endeavour to create a strong base for development of scientific thinking with emphasis on application of scientific principles and interventions to solve location specific problems.
TSCOST has been treading on a visionary approach in spreading Science & Technology across the State with a view to align the people and society to reap the benefits of Research and Development undertaken by the vast resource pool of Scientists working in Scientific establishments.
Remarkable and unprecedented successes in the field of Science & Technology posted by our great Scientists made our Country India much stronger and self reliant in every field. We owe them a lot and should take the inspiration from such stalwarts of Indian Science to move forward.
I would earnestly request the eminent scientific and academic personalities to join hands with TSCOST for utilization of science, technology and innovation to alleviate location specific problems and to transform Telangana into a vibrant science-driven society.
Thanking you,
