Property Purchase - Precautions
Purchasing a property/land requires utmost care. One has to examine and find out the title of the seller or nature of his right. A seller can sell only what he possesses. Therefore if a seller has proper and valid title, on purchase you will get valid title. If the seller's title is defective, you will get only defective title. The simple reasoning is that he can sell what he has, and nothing more. When buying a property, legal due diligence is essential to avoid getting entangled in legal issues later. Here are some of the precautions you can take before finalizing a property deal.
Check the antecedents of the vendor(s) -
We all verify title deeds and all connected documents before buying the property. But we fail to verify the antecedents of the vendor(s) . It is better to verify the character and antecedents of the vendor(s) beforehand.If the vendor(s) are habitual offenders and involved in the real-estate offences or other crimes, then it is better to drop the idea of buying the property from them notwithstanding whether the title is perfect or not. If the vendor has good background; and his character and reputation are unquestionable, then the transaction will be very smooth. Even, in future, if there is any dispute regarding title or any other issue pertaining to the property, then you are dealing with a respectable person in the society; and you need not to spend your valuable money and time on unnecessary litigation. You are not facing any embarrassment in the shape of physical or verbal abuse. The issues can be resolved through gentlemen agreement without involving external forces.
Check the title of the property-
The title of the property forms the foundation of any contract. According to the Indian Contract Act, no seller can pass on to the purchaser a better title than what he already possesses. Therefore, the title of the seller must be clear and free from any encumbrance. Before you buy a property, verify the title of the seller. A search of the records at the sub-registrar's office may be carried out for documents that may affect the property and may have been registered .The report will show the recorded owner of title of the property and changes in the title of the property. If the land is an agriculture land then adangal/pahani/khata of that land or/and Pattadar Passbook and Title Deed can be requested from the seller.Assessment Register Ledger entry (called Khata in some parts of the country) is basically a supporting document of title. It is the entry of the present owner in the municipal/panchayat records relating to house properties. The absence of Assessment Register entry in the name of a current owner can be rectified at any time by applying for mutation. This has become important because it is required for loans, title opinions, electricity meter name change, etc. Assessment Register Ledger entry is changed after a sale deed is executed or after a property is inherited through a will, gift, partition, etc., if applied and requested for a mutation.
Verify the title of the seller-
The vendor may have acquired his title either by purchase, by inheritance, by partition, by gift, by settlement or by grant. To find out the source of title there must be some document like.
Rights accrued
Inheritance
Entries in revenue records, and predecessor's title
Partition
Deed of partition
Gift deed
Settlement
Settlement deed
Grant
Grant order
Release
Release deed
Mulgeni
Deed of Mulgeni or permanent lease
Personal inspection of property under sale (site/building/flat/agricultural land) -
Buyer beware is the golden mantra in the immovable property transactions. Therefore, the entire onus lies on the purchaser in verifying the title, ownership and possession of the property. He must take all reasonable steps to ensure that he is purchasing the property from a right person and also a right property. The most important precaution is undertaking a personal inspection of the property under the sale. During the personal inspection, the buyer shall inquire with the neighbours regarding the ownership and possession of the property, disputes if any, character of the vendor(s) , charges/mortgages on the property, joint owners of the property or part of the property etc. This is the most important aspect of the title verification, therefore, it is better at least three persons from buyer side shall take up this task. And they shall make discrete enquiries with various persons in and around the property like elders of the locality, longstanding property owners/tenants, workmen, etc. It is easy to undertake the inspection of site and building in the densely populated areas. It is also easy to enquire in villages where the people could identify persons by name. But it is difficult to enquire in the suburban, newly developing and agricultural lands converted as plots – where no habitation exists. In these cases a lot of effort is required to get the right answers to the questions and at times we may not get answers at all since there would be no person to contact except the vendor or his men.
Sale by holder of power of attorney-
-If the sale documents are being executed by a person holding power of attorney on behalf of the owner, the said power of attorney should be scrutinised thoroughly. The person must not only possess the power to sell property, the power of attorney should also be validly executed. An agreement holder (as explained above) who also has a power of attorney to sell the land and/or building is normally a developer. Alternatively, a person may have paid the entire consideration to the owner and holds on to the property for some time to sell it at a later date for a profit. The sale will be effected by the power of attorney holder on behalf of the owner. Such power of attorney must be properly stamped and registered (if it is coupled with sale agreement/development agreement/given for consideration) . It should also not be revoked.
Check the original documents-
Always inspect the original documents of the seller and read all the documents carefully before signing them. If the vendor states that the original documents were missing/stolen/lost, then it is better to know the full facts relating to missing documents. Know whether the vendor has filed a complaint in the concerned police station and got the copy of FIR with regard to missing of documents; and/or what are the other steps he had taken to trace them as a prudent person. There is a possibility of keeping the original documents in banks/financial institutions/private lenders to create mortgage/charge over the property by way of deposit of title deeds. So it is better to get full information regarding original documents that are missing. And it is always better to give a public notice with regard to purchase of the property on the basis of certified copies of the title deeds instead of original documents which were lost.
Colour Photostat copies – frauds-
Today, the technology used in colour Photostat machines is very advanced one; and copies generated using these machines are of high quality. Innocent purchasers can be duped by clever vendors by delivering colour Photostat copies instead of original. Therefore, a proper check shall be done in verifying whether the documents are original or colour Photostat copies.
Verify photographs and thumb impressions of the vendor-
Section 32A of Registration Act, 1908 prescribes that in case of sale deeds both the vendors and buyers should affix their photographs and thumb impressions along with the document. This provision has come into force from the year 2001. Therefore, if your vendor has acquired the property after 2001 through a registered document, then you have one more evidence to check regarding the identity of your vendor. Verify carefully the photographs and thumb impression of the vendor in the registered document where he appears as purchaser.
Tax receipt and bills-
Property taxes which are paid to government or municipality are a first charge on the property. Hence, enquiries must be made in government and municipal offices to ascertain whether all taxes have been paid up to date. The owner should also possess the latest tax receipts, which you may inspect. While investigating in different departments of the municipality, you need to ascertain whether any notices or requisitions relating to the property have been issued and are outstanding and not yet complied. While inspecting the property tax receipt, it can be noted that there are two columns in the tax receipt.Make sure that the name entered in the owner's column is correct. The second column will be for the name of the one who paid the tax. Sometimes the owner may not have the tax receipt with him, in such cases, contact the village office with the survey number of land and confirm the original owner of the land. If you are buying a house along with the property, then the house tax receipt should also be checked. Also make sure water bills and electricity bills have been paid up to date and if there is any balance payment to be made, ensure that it is made by the seller.
Encumbrance Certificate -
Before purchasing the land or house, it is important to confirm that the land does not have any legal dues. Check the
Encumbrance Certificate (EC)
Pledged land-
Some people may have taken loan from the bank by pledging their land. Ensure that the seller has paid back the entire amount due. Don't be satisfied with the receipt of the payment made. Release certificate issued by the bank is necessary for all the debts over the land. You could buy a land without the release certificate. But if you want to take a loan in future, the release certificate is a must.
Place a public notice-
-A public notice may be placed in newspapers calling for claims in respect of the property being purchased. Claims can come even afterwards, public notice helps in proving that you purchased the property bona fide and in good faith. This will prove that you have taken all measures that can be expected from bona fide and prudent purchaser thereby you will get favourable order/view from the Courts, in case of any litigation that may arise in future with regard to patent or latent defects in the title of the property.
Inspect the plans-
If the building is under construction then inspect the plans to check whether they have been sanctioned by the concerned authority. Also check whether the construction was done according to the plan approved by Municipal authority. If there is any deviation from the approved plan, then it is to be verified whether it can be regularized or not. In respect of deviation that can be regularized by paying penalty to the municipal authority, it is better to record, in the agreement, that who should pay that penalty to the municipal authority. If the deviation is not allowed to be regularized then the purchaser is taking the risk of demolition of the building partly/fully by the municipal authorities.
Payments of stamp duty-
Always verify documents of title to check payment of stamp duty. If the ownership of property has changed hands more than once, examine all the documents for payment of stamp duty by the predecessors. Today, many States (including Telangana and Andhra Pradesh) have amended the Stamp law providing for creation of charge over the property in case there is any deficit stamp duty in any document relating to property. Therefore, the present owner of the property obliged to pay the deficit stamp duty and penalties, if any on the documents registered earlier notwithstanding whether he is a party in it or not.
If the property belongs to a minor-
In case where the property is owned by a minor, prior approval of the court is required to enable the minor's other/natural guardian to sell the property. In the absence of such permission, the sale could be voidable at the option of the minor on attaining majority. Or otherwise, soon after attainment of majority, the sale has to be perfected by obtaining a registered ratification deed by the person who was a minor at the time of sale.
Check the minimum tenure of land if taken on lease-
If the flat that is being purchased is in a building built on a land which is given on lease, lease rent would have to be paid for the land by the flat owners. If the lease is to expire shortly, it is possible that the lease rent may increase substantially. Hence, the terms of the lease must be verified before buying the flat. In Telangana and Andhra Pradesh this sort of arrangement is not prominent.
Engage a competent lawyer-
There are several laws involved in immovable property transactions. Therefore, it is better to engage a competent lawyer to investigate the title, possession, ownership and other aspects. The lawyer shall associate and his scope of work shall include in investigating the title, negotiations, drafting of agreements/sale deeds, payment of consideration, registration of documents, mutation, etc.
Reputed attesting witnesses-
The attesting witnesses are the persons who actually witness the signing of the sale or any document by the parties and sign as witnesses on the document. It is always important to have reputed and respectable people as attesting witnesses. Attesting witness is an important and key witness in the civil litigation in case any court case arises in future. Their statement will be having a lot of weight in deciding the case. Therefore, it is advisable to request good and reputed young and middle aged people as attesting witness.
Check the occupation certificate-
Occupation certificate should be verified to ensure that the building has been built legally, especially in case of new buildings as per G.O.Ms.No. 86, Municipal Administration Department, Government of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Dated the 3rd March, 2006.
Check whether the flat/portion is mortgaged to Municipal authority-
As per the municipal regulations, the builder/owner shall create charge over 10% of the area under construction to ensure compliance with building regulations. So it is necessary to verify whether the flat/portion of the building under sale is mortgaged to the municipality. If it is mortgaged, then it is not possible to get a registered sale deed from the builder/owner. Purchaser has to wait till it is cleared by municipality.
Check the carpet area-
You can verify the carpet area by taking actual measurement of the property if the same is ready. Plinth area includes carpet area (area between the external walls of the flat/portion) and common areas (like passages, staircase, verandah, park etc) . Carpet area and common area ratio varies from 88:12 to 75:25. If carpet area ratio is more, then you will get more exclusive space within your flat on the other hand common area wherein all co-owners will have the title, possession, access, will be more.
Search for records-
A search of the records at the sub-registrar's office may be carried out for documents that may affect the property and may have been registered. Section 57 of
Registration Act, 1908
Registrar/Sub Registrar Offices
Certified copies-
When copies of the documents are given for perusal, the buyer need rely only on them, but instead can apply for certified copies too. The certified copies of the back (link) documents should also be obtained. The copies of the sale deeds are preserved in the Sub-Registrar's office in Book 1 and are given to anyone on application after paying a prescribed fee. Power of attorney is a document in which the principal grants authority to an agent to act on his behalf. Through executive instructions, today, in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the power of attorney if given in respect of immovable property is registered in Book 1 so as to enable the interested parties to get certified copy of it. This step is a progressive one since it will check frauds being played, to some extent, under the guise of power of attorney as it is no more a confidential document.
NOC of the society-
It is advisable to obtain a no dues certificate and no encumbrance certificate from the society (if the property is in the society) to ensure that all dues are paid and no mortgage is registered with the society in respect of the property being purchased. In case the property is in a society, check that all the society forms are duly filled and signed.

Sale Deed Preparation - Requirements and Precautions
Requirements of Sale Deed:
Sale deed is one of the most valuable legal documents in a purchase or sale of a property. A sale deed is drafted by legal draftsman on a non-judicial stamp paper of the requisite value as prescribed by stamp act of the particular state concerned. Today, in many States including Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the stamp papers are available up to the value of Rs.100/- only. The parties shall use 5-6 Non-Judicial stamp papers and remaining amount shall be paid through challan system (AP) and through stamping and other mechanism provided by the State Government (in others States). A draftsman must include certain clauses while preparing the construction of the sale deed which are as follows:
Name of the deed:
It is the parties who have to decide that which deed has to be prepared e.g. DEED OF SALE or DEED OF MORTGAGE or DEED OF LEASE etc. and based on which there will be transfer of ownership of immovable property. Since this Sale deed, parties may use DEED OF SALE (OR) SALE DEED.
Parties to sale deed:
An absolute sale deed must contain the names, age and respective addresses of parties to the transaction and both the parties i.e. seller and buyer must be competent to enter into a contract so that it will not affect the validity of the valid sale. It is very much important that the sale deed is duly signed and executed by both the parties with their bona-fide intention. A valid sale deed must start with clear description of the parties.
Description of the property sold
A valid sale deed must contain full description of the property which is the subject matter of sale. It must include identification number, total plot area, construction details as well as its location with its surrounding areas. A schedule of the property must be included in the sale deed which will define the exact location where the property is actually situated.
Agreement for sale:
In the agreement for sale both the parties may mutually settle the terms and conditions of the agreement so that it will not affect the rights of the parties. A sale deed may be preceded by agreement to sell.
Sale consideration clause:
A sale deed must include the clause stating the sale consideration/amount as agreed between the seller and the buyer which has to be paid by the buyer to the seller on the execution of sale deed. A sale amount should be clearly stated in sale deed as agreed in the agreement to sell so that there should not be any onus on the parties to the transaction.
Advance payment, if any:
If there is any transaction of token amount paid by the buyer to the seller then it has to be clearly mentioned in the sale deed, and how much is the remaining balance to be paid on the execution of the sale deed.
Mode of payment:
It is always the buyer who has to decide that how he is going to pay the sale consideration amount whether by Cash /Cheque/ Demand Draft and the same has to be agreed by the seller.
Passing of the title:
A sale deed should contain the clause when the original title of the property to be passed to the purchaser. A time limit should be given to the seller for the transfer of the title. Once the title of the immovable property is transferred, all the rights will pass to the purchaser.
Delivery of the possession:
The possession of the immovable property will be transferred to the purchaser by the vendor once the registration process is completed. A clause in the sale deed must state when there will be actual delivery of the possession.
Indemnity provision if any:
A seller must clear all the statutory charges i.e. property tax, electricity charges, water bills, cess, society charges, maintenance charges and all other charges relating to the property before the execution of the sale deed. In case there is any encumbrance on the property, the seller needs to repay the loan amount and get the property papers cleared of the encumbrance. It is the duty of the buyer to verify the encumbrance status from the office of the Registrar/Sub Registrar/Mee Seva Centres (in AP).
Execution:
Once the Sale Deed is prepared all the parties to the deed shall execute it by affixing their thumb impression or full signature. Each page should be signed by the seller and buyer. Any erasure, alteration, addition or deletion is to be authenticated by full signature of the parties. Execution of the sale deed requires to be witnessed by two witnesses. The witnesses shall give their full particulars and addresses.
Registration According to Section:
17 of "The Registration Act, 1908", the registration of a tangible immovable property is compulsory if the value of the respective property exceeds rupees 100/- and it is the registration of the property which makes the sale valid. For getting the registration done both the parties must be present in person or through their duly authorized agent(s) before the jurisdictional sub-registrar office with the original documents within four months from the date of execution. A stamp duty has to be paid by the purchaser to the sub-registrar for getting the registration done. A certified copy of the registration document to be obtained for the future reference.
Testatum:
Once all the terms and conditions have been settled between both the parties, a sale deed is prepared. The executed sale deed should be witnessed by at least two witnesses one from seller side and one from buyer side, giving their full names, addresses and signatures.
Original documents:
Once the property gets registered under the registration act all the original documents of the sold property to be hand over by the seller to the purchaser. All the statutory rights along with ownership, possession, title, interest will get vested in favour of the purchaser.
Default clause:
An agreement for sale of immovable property should include the clause stating if there is any default by the vendor or the purchaser then the party who rescinds the contract need to pay damages to the other party for the breach of contract so that it will not affect to the execution of the sale deed.
Since drafting of sale deed requires abundant caution and presence of mind with sufficient knowledge of property and other allied laws, it would be better if services of advocates who have vast experience in property transactions are utilized to avoid unexpected and uncalled for litigations which may arise in a poorly drafted sale deed.

Document Preparation Precautions
Document preparation – checks and cautions
Document writing is a professional job. So it is expected that the person who prepares the document shall act as a professional and delivers a good product to the user. You may be a buyer, lessee, mortgagee, member in a partition deed or a document writer or any other person connected with documentation – whatever relation you have with the document in question, you require to take the following precautions in document writing/document preparation. The following are certain precautions one must take while preparing a document.
Check the names and spelling of the parties:
Names of the parties are material part of the document. Therefore, the names of the parties shall be correctly recorded in the document. To ensure this, if the document is prepared in English language, verify the academic records/passport/aadhaar card etc to get correct spelling (names) of the parties including surname. In case a person name is recorded differently in different records, then mention the different versions of the name as alias.
If a woman name in is recorded as daughter of a person in one link document and; subsequently in another document her name was recorded as wife of a person, then it is better to reconcile and record both the status to avoid confusion. Father/husband name shall be recorded correctly. Get full and accurate information from the parties.
Any small mistake in the names of the parties will result in execution of a rectification deed. This will put the parties in unnecessary troubles. The vendors may not be available in the station or whereabouts of them may not be known to the purchasers. The vendors may demand additional amounts or put many conditions to execute rectification deed in favour of the purchasers. Therefore, it is the duty of the person who prepares the document to take all the care and caution to record names of the all the parties correctly.
Age of the parties:
Record correct age of the parties by verifying records available. Don't put approximate age by seeing the physical appearance of the persons. It is advisable to ascertain and record correct age of the parties.
Profession and addresses:
Profession of the parties, present and permanent addresses shall be recorded in the document without any mistakes.
Vague description of the parties will create confusion. Therefore, give full and comprehensive information of these important aspects. Take some time and verify twice or thrice and get it cross-checked by another person to ensure that there will not be any mistake in these aspects.
Link document numbers:
Record correctly the link document number, date of registration, Book Number/CD volume number, page number in book, Sub Registrar/Registrar Office name, and District name correctly. Many a time parties fail to record correct link document numbers and thereby forced to execute rectification deeds subsequently by the bankers and other interested parties. The names of the vendors and vendees of the link documents if recorded in the present document, then they shall be recorded as they exist in such previous documents without any variations.
Consideration:
Record details of consideration paid in numbers and words without any mistake. This is a material part of documentation; therefore, full care shall be taken to record the consideration without any mistake.
Cheque Number/DD Number etc:
If the amount is paid through a cheque or DD or Pay Order then the details such as the number, date of issue, bank and branch name and the amount shall be recorded without any mistakes. Check correctly these details. There is every possibility of committing mistakes in recording these details. Take expert's advice in recording DD/pay order numbers.
Schedule of the property:
This is very important part of the document. This part describes the details of the property by mentioning in which village/city it is situated.
Agriculture property:
Village name, mandal name, district name, sub registrar office name, survey number(s), full extent of the survey number(s), the extent now being transacted under the document (survey number wise), all the four boundaries.
Open Plot:
Village name, mandal name, district name, sub registrar office name, survey number/town survey number, plot number, total extent of the plot, the extent now being transacted under the document if part of the plot is transacted, all the four boundaries.
House/commercial units:
Village name, mandal name, district name, sub registrar office name, survey number/town survey number, plot number, municipal/panchayat assessment number, door number new and old, extent of the land, plinth area of structures, all the four boundaries.
Flat in an apartment:
Village name, mandal name, district name, sub registrar office name, survey number/town survey number, plot number, total extent of the plot along with four boundaries for the entire piece of land on which the entire apartment structure is raised as Schedule 1. Flat number, plinth area (including common areas), all the four boundaries of the flat, car parking area and undivided share of land as Schedule 2.
Try to get full information of owners abutting the property and falling in the boundaries and record their names instead of mentioning them vaguely like 'the neighbour's property'. If there is a road in one of the boundaries, then mention its width also; if there is a name to the road them mention name of the road. If the full survey number (agricultural land) is transacted, there is no need to record the details boundaries. But if the parties interested then they may also be recorded.
Take abundant caution and care to record correctly these details. Check twice or thrice. Get it cross-checked by a person who got critical eye in catching the mistakes.
Attesting witnesses:
Attesting witnesses play a vital role in case of dispute regarding the document's validity. Therefore, select reputed and persons having good conduct as attesting witnesses. Attesting witnesses are the persons who see the very signing (execution) of the document by the parties under the document. Their version regarding the execution of the document will be very important and crucial in case of any dispute regarding validity of the document in the court of law. As human beings are mortals, see that the young or middle-aged persons are secured as attesting witnesses to the document. As per Transfer of Property Act, the statutory requirement is two attesting witnesses; but if parties wish then more than two persons may be taken as attesting witnesses.
Not only the above, the parties shall take care of all the recordings in the document since it is a formal, legal, contract document. Give full, comprehensive and factual information in the document; ensuring that their interests are safeguarded. Instead of leaving it to the document writers / advocates alone, the parties shall also actively participate in preparation of document particularly in verification of the details word by word.

Accordingly, the various forms prescribed under the Indian Partnership Act,
1932, for the alterations in the registered partnership firm are:-
Form No.VI
Partnership Act, 1932 does not provide for compulsory registration of firms. It is
optional for partners to set the firm registered and there are no penalties for nonregistration.
However, Section 69 of the Act which deals with the effects of non-registration denies
certain rights to an unregistered firm. Under the Act :-
A partner of an unregistered firm cannot file a suit in any court against the
firm or other partners for the enforcement of any right arising from a contract
or right conferred by the Partnership Act unless the firm is registered and the
person suing is or has been shown in the Register of Firms as a partner in the
firm.
No suits to enforce a right arising from a contract shall be instituted in any
Court by or on behalf of a firm against any third party unless the firm is
registered and the persons suing are or have been shown in the Register of
Firms as partners in the firm.
An unregistered firm or any of its partners cannot claim a set off (i.e. mutual
adjustment of debts owned by the disputant parties to one another) or other
proceedings in a dispute with a third party. Hence, every firm finds it
advisable to get itself registered sooner or later.
However, non-registration of a Partnership firm shall not affect:-
The rights of third parties to sue the firm and/or its partners.
The firms or partners in the firms which have no place of business in the
territories to which this Act extends, or whose places of business in the said
territories are situated in areas to which the act does not apply.
any suit or claim or set-off not exceeding one hundred rupees in value which,
in the Presidency-towns, is not of a kind specified in Section 19 of the
Presidency Small Cause Courts Act, 1882 (15 of 1882), or outside the
Presidency- towns, is not of a kind specified in the Second Schedule to the
Provincial small Cause Courts Act, 1887 (9 of 1887), to any proceeding in
execution or other proceeding incidental to or arising from any such suit or
claim.
the enforcement of any right to sue for the dissolution of a firm or for accounts
of a dissolved firm, or any right or power to realise the property of a dissolved
firm.
the powers of an official assignee, receiver or Court under the Presidencytowns
Insolvency Act, 1909 (3 of 1909), or the Provincial Insolvency Act,
1920 (5 of 1920), to realise the property of an insolvent partner.
Rectification of mistakes (Section 64 of the Act)
The Registrar shall have power at all times to rectify any mistake in order to
bring the entry in the Register of Firms relating to any firm into conformity
with the documents relating to that firm filed under this Act.
On application made by all the parties who have signed any document relating
to a firm filed under this Act, the Registrar may rectify any mistake in such
document or in the record or note thereof made in the Register of Firms.
Inspection of Register and filed documents (Section 66 of the Act)
The Register of Firms shall be open to inspection by any person on payment of
such fee as may be prescribed.
All statements, notices and intimations filed under this Act shall be open to
inspection, subject to such conditions and on payment of such fee as may be
prescribed.

Under Section 58 of the Act, a firm may be registered at any time (not merely at the
time of its formation but subsequently also) by filing an application with the Registrar of Firms (the District Registrar, Registration and Stamps Department in the State of Telangana) of the area in which any place of business of the firm is situated or proposed to be situated

Any alterations, subsequent to Registration shall be notified to the registrar:-

events shall require sending of a new application form along with the
prescribed fee, duly signed and verified by all the partners.
Change relating to opening and closing of branches. (Section 61)--- When a

Accordingly, the various forms prescribed under the Indian Partnership Act,
1932, for the alterations in the registered partnership firm are:-
Form No.VI
Partnership Act, 1932 does not provide for compulsory registration of firms. It is
optional for partners to set the firm registered and there are no penalties for nonregistration.
However, Section 69 of the Act which deals with the effects of non-registration denies
certain rights to an unregistered firm. Under the Act :-
A partner of an unregistered firm cannot file a suit in any court against the
firm or other partners for the enforcement of any right arising from a contract
or right conferred by the Partnership Act unless the firm is registered and the
person suing is or has been shown in the Register of Firms as a partner in the
firm.
No suits to enforce a right arising from a contract shall be instituted in any
Court by or on behalf of a firm against any third party unless the firm is
registered and the persons suing are or have been shown in the Register of
Firms as partners in the firm.
An unregistered firm or any of its partners cannot claim a set off (i.e. mutual
adjustment of debts owned by the disputant parties to one another) or other
proceedings in a dispute with a third party. Hence, every firm finds it
advisable to get itself registered sooner or later.
However, non-registration of a Partnership firm shall not affect:-
The rights of third parties to sue the firm and/or its partners.
The firms or partners in the firms which have no place of business in the
territories to which this Act extends, or whose places of business in the said
territories are situated in areas to which the act does not apply.
any suit or claim or set-off not exceeding one hundred rupees in value which,
in the Presidency-towns, is not of a kind specified in Section 19 of the
Presidency Small Cause Courts Act, 1882 (15 of 1882), or outside the
Presidency- towns, is not of a kind specified in the Second Schedule to the
Provincial small Cause Courts Act, 1887 (9 of 1887), to any proceeding in
execution or other proceeding incidental to or arising from any such suit or
claim.
the enforcement of any right to sue for the dissolution of a firm or for accounts
of a dissolved firm, or any right or power to realise the property of a dissolved
firm.
the powers of an official assignee, receiver or Court under the Presidencytowns
Insolvency Act, 1909 (3 of 1909), or the Provincial Insolvency Act,
1920 (5 of 1920), to realise the property of an insolvent partner.

bring the entry in the Register of Firms relating to any firm into conformity
with the documents relating to that firm filed under this Act.

to a firm filed under this Act, the Registrar may rectify any mistake in such
document or in the record or note thereof made in the Register of Firms.
Inspection of Register and filed documents (Section 66 of the Act)
The Register of Firms shall be open to inspection by any person on payment of
such fee as may be prescribed.
All statements, notices and intimations filed under this Act shall be open to
inspection, subject to such conditions and on payment of such fee as may be
prescribed.

Document Preparation Precautions
Document preparation – checks and cautions
Document writing is a professional job. So it is expected that the person who prepares the document shall act as a professional and delivers a good product to the user. You may be a buyer, lessee, mortgagee, member in a partition deed or a document writer or any other person connected with documentation – whatever relation you have with the document in question, you require to take the following precautions in document writing/document preparation. The following are certain precautions one must take while preparing a document.
Check the names and spelling of the parties:
Names of the parties are material part of the document. Therefore, the names of the parties shall be correctly recorded in the document. To ensure this, if the document is prepared in English language, verify the academic records/passport/aadhaar card etc to get correct spelling (names) of the parties including surname. In case a person name is recorded differently in different records, then mention the different versions of the name as alias.
If a woman name in is recorded as daughter of a person in one link document and; subsequently in another document her name was recorded as wife of a person, then it is better to reconcile and record both the status to avoid confusion. Father/husband name shall be recorded correctly. Get full and accurate information from the parties.
Any small mistake in the names of the parties will result in execution of a rectification deed. This will put the parties in unnecessary troubles. The vendors may not be available in the station or whereabouts of them may not be known to the purchasers. The vendors may demand additional amounts or put many conditions to execute rectification deed in favour of the purchasers. Therefore, it is the duty of the person who prepares the document to take all the care and caution to record names of the all the parties correctly.
Age of the parties:
Record correct age of the parties by verifying records available. Don't put approximate age by seeing the physical appearance of the persons. It is advisable to ascertain and record correct age of the parties.
Profession and addresses:
Profession of the parties, present and permanent addresses shall be recorded in the document without any mistakes.
Vague description of the parties will create confusion. Therefore, give full and comprehensive information of these important aspects. Take some time and verify twice or thrice and get it cross-checked by another person to ensure that there will not be any mistake in these aspects.
Link document numbers:
Record correctly the link document number, date of registration, Book Number/CD volume number, page number in book, Sub Registrar/Registrar Office name, and District name correctly. Many a time parties fail to record correct link document numbers and thereby forced to execute rectification deeds subsequently by the bankers and other interested parties. The names of the vendors and vendees of the link documents if recorded in the present document, then they shall be recorded as they exist in such previous documents without any variations.
Consideration:
Record details of consideration paid in numbers and words without any mistake. This is a material part of documentation; therefore, full care shall be taken to record the consideration without any mistake.
Cheque Number/DD Number etc:
If the amount is paid through a cheque or DD or Pay Order then the details such as the number, date of issue, bank and branch name and the amount shall be recorded without any mistakes. Check correctly these details. There is every possibility of committing mistakes in recording these details. Take expert's advice in recording DD/pay order numbers.
Schedule of the property:
This is very important part of the document. This part describes the details of the property by mentioning in which village/city it is situated.
Agriculture property:
Village name, mandal name, district name, sub registrar office name, survey number(s), full extent of the survey number(s), the extent now being transacted under the document (survey number wise), all the four boundaries.
Open Plot:
Village name, mandal name, district name, sub registrar office name, survey number/town survey number, plot number, total extent of the plot, the extent now being transacted under the document if part of the plot is transacted, all the four boundaries.
House/commercial units:
Village name, mandal name, district name, sub registrar office name, survey number/town survey number, plot number, municipal/panchayat assessment number, door number new and old, extent of the land, plinth area of structures, all the four boundaries.
Flat in an apartment:
Village name, mandal name, district name, sub registrar office name, survey number/town survey number, plot number, total extent of the plot along with four boundaries for the entire piece of land on which the entire apartment structure is raised as Schedule 1. Flat number, plinth area (including common areas), all the four boundaries of the flat, car parking area and undivided share of land as Schedule 2.
Try to get full information of owners abutting the property and falling in the boundaries and record their names instead of mentioning them vaguely like 'the neighbour's property'. If there is a road in one of the boundaries, then mention its width also; if there is a name to the road them mention name of the road. If the full survey number (agricultural land) is transacted, there is no need to record the details boundaries. But if the parties interested then they may also be recorded.
Take abundant caution and care to record correctly these details. Check twice or thrice. Get it cross-checked by a person who got critical eye in catching the mistakes.
Attesting witnesses:
Attesting witnesses play a vital role in case of dispute regarding the document's validity. Therefore, select reputed and persons having good conduct as attesting witnesses. Attesting witnesses are the persons who see the very signing (execution) of the document by the parties under the document. Their version regarding the execution of the document will be very important and crucial in case of any dispute regarding validity of the document in the court of law. As human beings are mortals, see that the young or middle-aged persons are secured as attesting witnesses to the document. As per Transfer of Property Act, the statutory requirement is two attesting witnesses; but if parties wish then more than two persons may be taken as attesting witnesses.
Not only the above, the parties shall take care of all the recordings in the document since it is a formal, legal, contract document. Give full, comprehensive and factual information in the document; ensuring that their interests are safeguarded. Instead of leaving it to the document writers / advocates alone, the parties shall also actively participate in preparation of document particularly in verification of the details word by word.

Property Purchase - Precautions
Purchasing a property/land requires utmost care. One has to examine and find out the title of the seller or nature of his right. A seller can sell only what he possesses. Therefore if a seller has proper and valid title, on purchase you will get valid title. If the seller's title is defective, you will get only defective title. The simple reasoning is that he can sell what he has, and nothing more. When buying a property, legal due diligence is essential to avoid getting entangled in legal issues later. Here are some of the precautions you can take before finalizing a property deal.
Check the antecedents of the vendor(s) -
We all verify title deeds and all connected documents before buying the property. But we fail to verify the antecedents of the vendor(s) . It is better to verify the character and antecedents of the vendor(s) beforehand.If the vendor(s) are habitual offenders and involved in the real-estate offences or other crimes, then it is better to drop the idea of buying the property from them notwithstanding whether the title is perfect or not. If the vendor has good background; and his character and reputation are unquestionable, then the transaction will be very smooth. Even, in future, if there is any dispute regarding title or any other issue pertaining to the property, then you are dealing with a respectable person in the society; and you need not to spend your valuable money and time on unnecessary litigation. You are not facing any embarrassment in the shape of physical or verbal abuse. The issues can be resolved through gentlemen agreement without involving external forces.
Check the title of the property-
The title of the property forms the foundation of any contract. According to the Indian Contract Act, no seller can pass on to the purchaser a better title than what he already possesses. Therefore, the title of the seller must be clear and free from any encumbrance. Before you buy a property, verify the title of the seller. A search of the records at the sub-registrar's office may be carried out for documents that may affect the property and may have been registered .The report will show the recorded owner of title of the property and changes in the title of the property. If the land is an agriculture land then adangal/pahani/khata of that land or/and Pattadar Passbook and Title Deed can be requested from the seller.Assessment Register Ledger entry (called Khata in some parts of the country) is basically a supporting document of title. It is the entry of the present owner in the municipal/panchayat records relating to house properties. The absence of Assessment Register entry in the name of a current owner can be rectified at any time by applying for mutation. This has become important because it is required for loans, title opinions, electricity meter name change, etc. Assessment Register Ledger entry is changed after a sale deed is executed or after a property is inherited through a will, gift, partition, etc., if applied and requested for a mutation.
Verify the title of the seller-
The vendor may have acquired his title either by purchase, by inheritance, by partition, by gift, by settlement or by grant. To find out the source of title there must be some document like.
Rights accrued
Inheritance
Entries in revenue records, and predecessor's title
Partition
Deed of partition
Gift deed
Settlement
Settlement deed
Grant
Grant order
Release
Release deed
Mulgeni
Deed of Mulgeni or permanent lease
Personal inspection of property under sale (site/building/flat/agricultural land) -
Buyer beware is the golden mantra in the immovable property transactions. Therefore, the entire onus lies on the purchaser in verifying the title, ownership and possession of the property. He must take all reasonable steps to ensure that he is purchasing the property from a right person and also a right property. The most important precaution is undertaking a personal inspection of the property under the sale. During the personal inspection, the buyer shall inquire with the neighbours regarding the ownership and possession of the property, disputes if any, character of the vendor(s) , charges/mortgages on the property, joint owners of the property or part of the property etc. This is the most important aspect of the title verification, therefore, it is better at least three persons from buyer side shall take up this task. And they shall make discrete enquiries with various persons in and around the property like elders of the locality, longstanding property owners/tenants, workmen, etc. It is easy to undertake the inspection of site and building in the densely populated areas. It is also easy to enquire in villages where the people could identify persons by name. But it is difficult to enquire in the suburban, newly developing and agricultural lands converted as plots – where no habitation exists. In these cases a lot of effort is required to get the right answers to the questions and at times we may not get answers at all since there would be no person to contact except the vendor or his men.
Sale by holder of power of attorney-
-If the sale documents are being executed by a person holding power of attorney on behalf of the owner, the said power of attorney should be scrutinised thoroughly. The person must not only possess the power to sell property, the power of attorney should also be validly executed. An agreement holder (as explained above) who also has a power of attorney to sell the land and/or building is normally a developer. Alternatively, a person may have paid the entire consideration to the owner and holds on to the property for some time to sell it at a later date for a profit. The sale will be effected by the power of attorney holder on behalf of the owner. Such power of attorney must be properly stamped and registered (if it is coupled with sale agreement/development agreement/given for consideration) . It should also not be revoked.
Check the original documents-
Always inspect the original documents of the seller and read all the documents carefully before signing them. If the vendor states that the original documents were missing/stolen/lost, then it is better to know the full facts relating to missing documents. Know whether the vendor has filed a complaint in the concerned police station and got the copy of FIR with regard to missing of documents; and/or what are the other steps he had taken to trace them as a prudent person. There is a possibility of keeping the original documents in banks/financial institutions/private lenders to create mortgage/charge over the property by way of deposit of title deeds. So it is better to get full information regarding original documents that are missing. And it is always better to give a public notice with regard to purchase of the property on the basis of certified copies of the title deeds instead of original documents which were lost.
Colour Photostat copies – frauds-
Today, the technology used in colour Photostat machines is very advanced one; and copies generated using these machines are of high quality. Innocent purchasers can be duped by clever vendors by delivering colour Photostat copies instead of original. Therefore, a proper check shall be done in verifying whether the documents are original or colour Photostat copies.
Verify photographs and thumb impressions of the vendor-
Section 32A of Registration Act, 1908 prescribes that in case of sale deeds both the vendors and buyers should affix their photographs and thumb impressions along with the document. This provision has come into force from the year 2001. Therefore, if your vendor has acquired the property after 2001 through a registered document, then you have one more evidence to check regarding the identity of your vendor. Verify carefully the photographs and thumb impression of the vendor in the registered document where he appears as purchaser.
Tax receipt and bills-
Property taxes which are paid to government or municipality are a first charge on the property. Hence, enquiries must be made in government and municipal offices to ascertain whether all taxes have been paid up to date. The owner should also possess the latest tax receipts, which you may inspect. While investigating in different departments of the municipality, you need to ascertain whether any notices or requisitions relating to the property have been issued and are outstanding and not yet complied. While inspecting the property tax receipt, it can be noted that there are two columns in the tax receipt.Make sure that the name entered in the owner's column is correct. The second column will be for the name of the one who paid the tax. Sometimes the owner may not have the tax receipt with him, in such cases, contact the village office with the survey number of land and confirm the original owner of the land. If you are buying a house along with the property, then the house tax receipt should also be checked. Also make sure water bills and electricity bills have been paid up to date and if there is any balance payment to be made, ensure that it is made by the seller.
Encumbrance Certificate -
Before purchasing the land or house, it is important to confirm that the land does not have any legal dues. Check the
Encumbrance Certificate (EC)
Pledged land-
Some people may have taken loan from the bank by pledging their land. Ensure that the seller has paid back the entire amount due. Don't be satisfied with the receipt of the payment made. Release certificate issued by the bank is necessary for all the debts over the land. You could buy a land without the release certificate. But if you want to take a loan in future, the release certificate is a must.
Place a public notice-
-A public notice may be placed in newspapers calling for claims in respect of the property being purchased. Claims can come even afterwards, public notice helps in proving that you purchased the property bona fide and in good faith. This will prove that you have taken all measures that can be expected from bona fide and prudent purchaser thereby you will get favourable order/view from the Courts, in case of any litigation that may arise in future with regard to patent or latent defects in the title of the property.
Inspect the plans-
If the building is under construction then inspect the plans to check whether they have been sanctioned by the concerned authority. Also check whether the construction was done according to the plan approved by Municipal authority. If there is any deviation from the approved plan, then it is to be verified whether it can be regularized or not. In respect of deviation that can be regularized by paying penalty to the municipal authority, it is better to record, in the agreement, that who should pay that penalty to the municipal authority. If the deviation is not allowed to be regularized then the purchaser is taking the risk of demolition of the building partly/fully by the municipal authorities.
Payments of stamp duty-
Always verify documents of title to check payment of stamp duty. If the ownership of property has changed hands more than once, examine all the documents for payment of stamp duty by the predecessors. Today, many States (including Telangana and Andhra Pradesh) have amended the Stamp law providing for creation of charge over the property in case there is any deficit stamp duty in any document relating to property. Therefore, the present owner of the property obliged to pay the deficit stamp duty and penalties, if any on the documents registered earlier notwithstanding whether he is a party in it or not.
If the property belongs to a minor-
In case where the property is owned by a minor, prior approval of the court is required to enable the minor's other/natural guardian to sell the property. In the absence of such permission, the sale could be voidable at the option of the minor on attaining majority. Or otherwise, soon after attainment of majority, the sale has to be perfected by obtaining a registered ratification deed by the person who was a minor at the time of sale.
Check the minimum tenure of land if taken on lease-
If the flat that is being purchased is in a building built on a land which is given on lease, lease rent would have to be paid for the land by the flat owners. If the lease is to expire shortly, it is possible that the lease rent may increase substantially. Hence, the terms of the lease must be verified before buying the flat. In Telangana and Andhra Pradesh this sort of arrangement is not prominent.
Engage a competent lawyer-
There are several laws involved in immovable property transactions. Therefore, it is better to engage a competent lawyer to investigate the title, possession, ownership and other aspects. The lawyer shall associate and his scope of work shall include in investigating the title, negotiations, drafting of agreements/sale deeds, payment of consideration, registration of documents, mutation, etc.
Reputed attesting witnesses-
The attesting witnesses are the persons who actually witness the signing of the sale or any document by the parties and sign as witnesses on the document. It is always important to have reputed and respectable people as attesting witnesses. Attesting witness is an important and key witness in the civil litigation in case any court case arises in future. Their statement will be having a lot of weight in deciding the case. Therefore, it is advisable to request good and reputed young and middle aged people as attesting witness.
Check the occupation certificate-
Occupation certificate should be verified to ensure that the building has been built legally, especially in case of new buildings as per G.O.Ms.No. 86, Municipal Administration Department, Government of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Dated the 3rd March, 2006.
Check whether the flat/portion is mortgaged to Municipal authority-
As per the municipal regulations, the builder/owner shall create charge over 10% of the area under construction to ensure compliance with building regulations. So it is necessary to verify whether the flat/portion of the building under sale is mortgaged to the municipality. If it is mortgaged, then it is not possible to get a registered sale deed from the builder/owner. Purchaser has to wait till it is cleared by municipality.
Check the carpet area-
You can verify the carpet area by taking actual measurement of the property if the same is ready. Plinth area includes carpet area (area between the external walls of the flat/portion) and common areas (like passages, staircase, verandah, park etc) . Carpet area and common area ratio varies from 88:12 to 75:25. If carpet area ratio is more, then you will get more exclusive space within your flat on the other hand common area wherein all co-owners will have the title, possession, access, will be more.
Search for records-
A search of the records at the sub-registrar's office may be carried out for documents that may affect the property and may have been registered. Section 57 of
Registration Act, 1908
Registrar/Sub Registrar Offices
Certified copies-
When copies of the documents are given for perusal, the buyer need rely only on them, but instead can apply for certified copies too. The certified copies of the back (link) documents should also be obtained. The copies of the sale deeds are preserved in the Sub-Registrar's office in Book 1 and are given to anyone on application after paying a prescribed fee. Power of attorney is a document in which the principal grants authority to an agent to act on his behalf. Through executive instructions, today, in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the power of attorney if given in respect of immovable property is registered in Book 1 so as to enable the interested parties to get certified copy of it. This step is a progressive one since it will check frauds being played, to some extent, under the guise of power of attorney as it is no more a confidential document.
NOC of the society-
It is advisable to obtain a no dues certificate and no encumbrance certificate from the society (if the property is in the society) to ensure that all dues are paid and no mortgage is registered with the society in respect of the property being purchased. In case the property is in a society, check that all the society forms are duly filled and signed.

Sale Deed Preparation - Requirements and Precautions
Requirements of Sale Deed:
Sale deed is one of the most valuable legal documents in a purchase or sale of a property. A sale deed is drafted by legal draftsman on a non-judicial stamp paper of the requisite value as prescribed by stamp act of the particular state concerned. Today, in many States including Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the stamp papers are available up to the value of Rs.100/- only. The parties shall use 5-6 Non-Judicial stamp papers and remaining amount shall be paid through challan system (AP) and through stamping and other mechanism provided by the State Government (in others States). A draftsman must include certain clauses while preparing the construction of the sale deed which are as follows:
Name of the deed:
It is the parties who have to decide that which deed has to be prepared e.g. DEED OF SALE or DEED OF MORTGAGE or DEED OF LEASE etc. and based on which there will be transfer of ownership of immovable property. Since this Sale deed, parties may use DEED OF SALE (OR) SALE DEED.
Parties to sale deed:
An absolute sale deed must contain the names, age and respective addresses of parties to the transaction and both the parties i.e. seller and buyer must be competent to enter into a contract so that it will not affect the validity of the valid sale. It is very much important that the sale deed is duly signed and executed by both the parties with their bona-fide intention. A valid sale deed must start with clear description of the parties.
Description of the property sold
A valid sale deed must contain full description of the property which is the subject matter of sale. It must include identification number, total plot area, construction details as well as its location with its surrounding areas. A schedule of the property must be included in the sale deed which will define the exact location where the property is actually situated.
Agreement for sale:
In the agreement for sale both the parties may mutually settle the terms and conditions of the agreement so that it will not affect the rights of the parties. A sale deed may be preceded by agreement to sell.
Sale consideration clause:
A sale deed must include the clause stating the sale consideration/amount as agreed between the seller and the buyer which has to be paid by the buyer to the seller on the execution of sale deed. A sale amount should be clearly stated in sale deed as agreed in the agreement to sell so that there should not be any onus on the parties to the transaction.
Advance payment, if any:
If there is any transaction of token amount paid by the buyer to the seller then it has to be clearly mentioned in the sale deed, and how much is the remaining balance to be paid on the execution of the sale deed.
Mode of payment:
It is always the buyer who has to decide that how he is going to pay the sale consideration amount whether by Cash /Cheque/ Demand Draft and the same has to be agreed by the seller.
Passing of the title:
A sale deed should contain the clause when the original title of the property to be passed to the purchaser. A time limit should be given to the seller for the transfer of the title. Once the title of the immovable property is transferred, all the rights will pass to the purchaser.
Delivery of the possession:
The possession of the immovable property will be transferred to the purchaser by the vendor once the registration process is completed. A clause in the sale deed must state when there will be actual delivery of the possession.
Indemnity provision if any:
A seller must clear all the statutory charges i.e. property tax, electricity charges, water bills, cess, society charges, maintenance charges and all other charges relating to the property before the execution of the sale deed. In case there is any encumbrance on the property, the seller needs to repay the loan amount and get the property papers cleared of the encumbrance. It is the duty of the buyer to verify the encumbrance status from the office of the Registrar/Sub Registrar/Mee Seva Centres (in AP).
Execution:
Once the Sale Deed is prepared all the parties to the deed shall execute it by affixing their thumb impression or full signature. Each page should be signed by the seller and buyer. Any erasure, alteration, addition or deletion is to be authenticated by full signature of the parties. Execution of the sale deed requires to be witnessed by two witnesses. The witnesses shall give their full particulars and addresses.
Registration According to Section:
17 of "The Registration Act, 1908", the registration of a tangible immovable property is compulsory if the value of the respective property exceeds rupees 100/- and it is the registration of the property which makes the sale valid. For getting the registration done both the parties must be present in person or through their duly authorized agent(s) before the jurisdictional sub-registrar office with the original documents within four months from the date of execution. A stamp duty has to be paid by the purchaser to the sub-registrar for getting the registration done. A certified copy of the registration document to be obtained for the future reference.
Testatum:
Once all the terms and conditions have been settled between both the parties, a sale deed is prepared. The executed sale deed should be witnessed by at least two witnesses one from seller side and one from buyer side, giving their full names, addresses and signatures.
Original documents:
Once the property gets registered under the registration act all the original documents of the sold property to be hand over by the seller to the purchaser. All the statutory rights along with ownership, possession, title, interest will get vested in favour of the purchaser.
Default clause:
An agreement for sale of immovable property should include the clause stating if there is any default by the vendor or the purchaser then the party who rescinds the contract need to pay damages to the other party for the breach of contract so that it will not affect to the execution of the sale deed.
Since drafting of sale deed requires abundant caution and presence of mind with sufficient knowledge of property and other allied laws, it would be better if services of advocates who have vast experience in property transactions are utilized to avoid unexpected and uncalled for litigations which may arise in a poorly drafted sale deed.

eEncumbrance Statement
The long awaited dream, enabling the Citizens to search on their own the Encumbrance on any property registered in Sub Registrar Offices has been made a practical reality with the advent of Information Technology. Now citizens can search for Encumbrance on 24X7 basis from anywhere through the medium of Internet.
The Source for generating encumbrance details for self-search and encumbrance certificate obtained in Sub Registrar Office is same. Hence for all practical purposes both are same. However, citizens who need ink signed Encumbrance certificate should approach SRO concern.
Online eEC is available for transaction post 01-01-1983 only. Hence if citizens require Encumbrance certificate prior to 01-01-1983, they should approach SRO office concern.
Search for eEC can be made on :
Document Number and Year of Document OR
House Number or Old House Number or Apartment name situated in a City/ Town/Village with optional Flat Number and Colony/Locality/Habitation OR
Survey number in a Revenue Village and optionally described by a Plot number.
District and SRO office selection is mandatory under all options.
Period of search is controlled as per the availability of data.
Users are advised to enter the house number following the standard format as Ward - Block - Door NO / Bi no. for better results.
As the data describing the property is not well structured and standardized due to legacy data and variation in description of the same property with respect to time because of changes in the classification of property, a probabilistic search is made and that may result in display of multiple results some of which may not be of any interest to the user. User should select the relevant entry for generating the statement on Encumbrances.
Disclaimer:
The encumbrances shown in the eEC are those discovered with reference to the description of properties furnished by the applicants at the time of Registration.
All efforts are made for accuracy of data. However in case of any conflict, original data shall prevail.
In case system responds by “Data Not Found”, for confirmation approach SRO concern.

(a) As defined under Sec.47A of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, market value of property is the value it would fetch if sold in the open market.
(b) Government has formed Committees to estimate market value of properties. They would survey and enquire regarding values of different localities in open market. They would collect the data from different sources like open auctions conducted by HUDA and other urban development authorities, Banks, Financial Institutions, registered documents reflecting real consideration, land acquisition compensation, etc. The committee will estimate the value from time to time as per laid down norms and principles and publish the same for information of public. The committees after hearing the objections, if any from the public will modify/amend the proposals or if they found the objections are unfounded, then they may go ahead to approve the proposed values. We have urban and rural committees to fix market values. Revenue Department, Municipal, ZillaParishad, Registration Department officials are part of this committee. From the year 2010, the market value guidelines registers are being published and sold through Sub Registrar and District Registrar Offices.
(c) When a document is presented to the Sub Registrar for registration, he will give market value slip in prescribed form about the market value of property. If the party concerned agrees to pay the stamp duty on such value, he will register the document.
(d) If parties to the document do not agree to pay stamp duty on the market value informed as above, the Sub Registrar will keep the document pending and refer the matter for determination of market value after collecting 50% of the deficit stamp duty as a deposit to refer it to the Collector (District Registrar) under Section 47A
(e) District Registrar will hear the parties and determine market value after spot inspection if necessary.
(f) Appeal may be preferred to the Civil Court within 60 days from the date of receipt of order of the District Registrar.
Q19. IS THERE PROVISION TO GET REFUND OF VALUE OF STAMP PAPERS NOT USED OR SPOILED ETC?
Yes, there is a provision to refund of value of NJ Stamp papers not used or spoiled under Indian Stamp Act, 1899. But in the State of Telangana, the NJ Stamp papers are available upto Rs.100/ - denomination only. Therefore, this provision serves no better purpose. But, the Government of issued a G.O., allowing refund of the. amounts paid through challan system. A copy of the G.O., may be seen
by clicking here....
Q20. IS THERE ANY TIME LIMIT FOR THE USAGE OF THE STAMP PAPERS PURCHASED?
Q21. HOW TO PREVENT USE OF FAKE STAMPS?
In Telangana State, sale of Non - judicial stamp papers is restricted to the denomination maximum of Rs.100/ -. Therefore, in a way, the Government has checked effectively the circulation of fake stamps by sale of the stamps from only authorized/licenced Stamp Vendors or from Government Offices (Sub Registrar and District Registrar Offices)/(postoffices). Remaining stamp duty can be paid through challan.
Q22. WHAT IS THE STAMP DUTY AND RE GISTRATION FEE PAYABLE FOR PARTITION AMONG JOINT FAMILY? ?
0.5% stamp duty to a maximum of Rs.20,000/- on the market value of the value of separated share. Example: If there are three parties by name A,B and C in a partition deed, Party by name A got Rs.500000/ - value of property. Party B got Rs.400000/ - and Party C got Rs.300000/ - . Now, the parties have to pay the stamp duty on the value of separate share means on Rs.4 and 3 lakhs exempting Rs.5 lakh. A stamp duty of Rs.3,500/ - has to be paid on this instrument of partition. In case all the shares are of equal value, then one share has to be exempted from calculation to levy stamp duty.

It  is  advisable  to  mention  the  name  of  the  wife  (br
ide)  before  and  after  marriage  at

e  usually  belongs  to  father’s 
family.  And  after  marriage,  the  surname  of  the  husb
and’s  family  is  adopted.  So  it  is 
advisable, to mention two names as

).
Eg. Wife (bride) name before marriage – Akaram Kum
ari;  
 Wife (bride) name after marriage – Vennem Kumari (

mediately bring them to the notice 
of the Sub Registrar and get them rectified.
In case of any discrepancy in the details found sub
sequently in the marriage certificate

procedure involved to get rectify 
such discrepancies.

ither wife or husband has 
been residing for at least six months immediately p
receding the date of

n  and  register  the  same  if  he  is 
requested to do so by submitting all the papers, pr
escribed fee in advance, if it (time) 
is convenient to him.
It  is  advised  to  take all the  precautions  and  thoro
ugh  check  of  the  documents  during 
marriage registration itself.
Rule   relating   to   marriage   registration   under   Hindu 
Marriage   Act   is   extracted 
hereunder:
5.  (1)  An  application  for  the  registration  of  a  Hi
ndu  Marriage,  shall  be  in 
Form 'A' and shall be signed by each party to the m
arriage or by the guardian 
of  such  party  and  shall  be  presented  in  person  befo
re  the  Registrar  in  whose 
jurisdiction  the  marriage  is  solemnized  or  before  t
he  Registrar  in  whose 
jurisdiction  either  party  to  the  marriage  has  been 
residing  for  at  least  six

Q37. IS IT COMPULSORY TO REGISTER GENERAL POWER OF ATTORNEY EXECUTED BY A PERSON RESIDING OUT OF INDIA AND ATTESTED BY         OFFICERS OF EMBASSY/CONSULATE/NOTARY PUBLIC IN THAT COUNTRY ?
It is not necessary to register. But Stamp duty as per Article 42 shall be paid within 3 months from the date of receipt of the power of attorney in India if it is not already stamped.
Q38. WHAT IS MEANT BY ENCUMBRANCE CERTIFICATE (EC)?
Encumbrance Certificate is a record showing registered transactions pertaining to a property. If mortgage, sale or any other deeds in respect of an immovable property are registered, indexing will be done by the Registration Department and this indexing is ultimately converted to generate an encumbrance certificate. Today, in Telangana, the Encumbrance Certificates are issued by MeeSeva Centres and Sub Registrar and District Registrar Offices.
Q39. WHAT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD BY NIL EC ?
?
If no deeds of transactions are registered in respect of a property mentioned in the application of EC, nil encumbrance certificate is issued. 
			  If Certificate is issued in this form, it means that there are no registered transactions / liabilities on the property for a given period of time; 
			  and unregistered transactions are not included in this certificate since such details are not available with Registration Department. People shall be 
			  very careful in filling the application form for EC; if they give incomplete/inaccurate details, they may get a wrong EC. Interested parties may approach 
			  the Sub Registrar and on paying prescribed fee, may be permitted to verify the records personally. EC cannot be taken as a sole criterion to buy a property
			  or lend money. 
			  It is better to undertake comprehensive study as suggested in property purchase precautions or Jagrattha short film on the website.
Q40. HOW TO OBTAIN CERTIFIED COPY OF A REGISTERED DOCUMENT?
Any person may obtain certified copy of registered document relating to immovable property.
Certified copy of registered will, may be obtained only by the testator only during his lifetime. Any person may get copy of a will after the death of the testator on production of death certificate.
Copies of registered deed of GPA and other documents relating to movables may be obtained by executant / claimant or agent, representative of such person only.
Stamp paper of Rs.20 is required to be produced along with a fee of Rs.200+User charges

HINDU MARRIAGE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS AND PRECAU
TIONs
Bride minimum age at the solemnisation of marriage 
– 18 years completed.
Bridegroom minimum age at the solemnisation of marr
iage - 21 years 
completed.
Form A in duplicate along with payment of prescribe
d fee.
Wedding invitation card.
A photograph of marriage ceremony capturing both wi
fe and husband.
Residential proof of either of the spouse.
Copies of SSC Certificates of wife and husband or p
assport copies (for Date 
of Birth proof).
Three witnesses to sign in the form.
Three witnesses to sign in the register of Registra
r office.
Check  thrice  the  details  filled  in  the  Form  A.  Name
s  of  the  bride  and  groom  shall 
always  be  tallied  with  the  names  given  in  the  passp
ort/SSC  and  other  certificates. 
Otherwise, at the time of issuance of visa and othe
r certificates, you may have to face 
problem.
It  is  advisable  to  mention  the  name  of  the  wife  (br
ide)  before  and  after  marriage  at 
Sl.No.  1  of  the  Form  A.  Before  marriage,  the  surnam
e  usually  belongs  to  father’s 
family.  And  after  marriage,  the  surname  of  the  husb
and’s  family  is  adopted.  So  it  is 
advisable, to mention two names as
name (before marriage), and   name (after marriage
).
Eg. Wife (bride) name before marriage – Akaram Kum
ari;  
 Wife (bride) name after marriage – Vennem Kumari (
Vennem is the surname of   
husband's family).
Check  the  certificate  issued  by  the  Sub  Registrar  o
ffice  and  if  there  are  any 
discrepancies in the names or any other details, im
mediately bring them to the notice 
of the Sub Registrar and get them rectified.
In case of any discrepancy in the details found sub
sequently in the marriage certificate 
issued by the Sub Registrar, there is a cumbersome 
procedure involved to get rectify 
such discrepancies.
The Marriage can be registered either –
At the Sub Registrar Office where the marriage venu
e is situated,
At the Sub Registrar Office in whose jurisdiction e
ither wife or husband has 
been residing for at least six months immediately p
receding the date of 
marriage.
Registrar  may  attend  the  marriage  ceremony  in  perso
n  and  register  the  same  if  he  is 
requested to do so by submitting all the papers, pr
escribed fee in advance, if it (time) 
is convenient to him.
It  is  advised  to  take all the  precautions  and  thoro
ugh  check  of  the  documents  during 
marriage registration itself.
Rule   relating   to   marriage   registration   under   Hindu 
Marriage   Act   is   extracted 
hereunder:
5.  (1)  An  application  for  the  registration  of  a  Hi
ndu  Marriage,  shall  be  in 
Form 'A' and shall be signed by each party to the m
arriage or by the guardian 
of  such  party  and  shall  be  presented  in  person  befo
re  the  Registrar  in  whose 
jurisdiction  the  marriage  is  solemnized  or  before  t
he  Registrar  in  whose 
jurisdiction  either  party  to  the  marriage  has  been 
residing  for  at  least  six 
months immediately preceding the date of marriage.
For  better  understanding  of  the  statutory  position,
  the  relevant  portion  of  Hindu 
Marriage Act, 1955 is given below:
Section 5. Conditions for a Hindu marriage
A marriage may be solemnised between any two Hindus
, if the following 
conditions are fulfilled, namely,-
neither party has a spouse living at the time of th
e marriage;
at  the  time  of  the  marriage,  neither  party-    is  inc
apable  of  giving  a  valid 
consent to it in consequence of unsoundness of mind
; or
though  capable  of  giving  a  valid  consent,  has  been 
suffering  from  mental 
disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to 
be unfit for marriage and the 
procreation of children; or
has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity o
r epilepsy;
the bridegroom has completed the age of twenty one 
years and the bride, the 
age of eighteen years at the time of the marriage;
the parties are not within the degrees of prohibite
d relationship, unless the

n the two.

DOCUMENT REGISTRATION - REQUIREMENTS AND PRECAUTION
The  Transfer  of  Property  Act  1882  and  Registration Act,  1908  prescribe 
compulsory registration of certain documents. Transfer of Property Act mandates that certain documents  to  be  valid;  they  should  give  “notice  to  the  world”.  Registration Act,  1908  gives  the  mechanism  to  the  concept  of  “notice  to  the  world”.  The documents registered in Book 1 of Registration Offices are public documents, so any public may inspect such book; get copies of the sam
e and a list of details of registered documents   chronologically   in   the   shape   of   an   Encumb
rance   Certificate   (EC). Documents   affecting   immovable   property   through   sale,   gift,   partition,   release, mortgage, lease, sale agreement are some of the compulsorily registerable documents. Registration  Act  is  one  of  the  oldest  legislations made  during  pre-Independence 
period  that  are  being  implemented  in  almost all parts  of the country  without  altering 
substantially  for  the  last  200  years.  Records  containing  the  copies  of  registered 
documents in Registration Offices are permanent in nature (philosophically speaking they  have  to  be  preserved  for  eternity);  therefore,  record  preservation  is  one  of  the prime  objectives  of  the  Registration  Department.  Civil  courts  heavily  depend  on  the records  of  Registration  Department  in  deciding  the issues  like  title,  ownership, possession of immovable properties.
Majority  of  parties  invariably  approach  solicitors,  advocates  or  professional document writers to get their documents prepared; and, at times, also for registration. But, it is better to know some of the important aspects of document and its registration so  as  to  check  whether  the  person  who  is  entrusted with  its  preparation  and registration is acting properly.
One must know that the Transfer of Property Act and other civil laws in India keep  the  onus  on  the  purchaser/beneficiary  under  the  document  to  take  all  the responsibility  of  verification  of  the  title,  ownership,  possession  of  property.  It  is  not the  responsibility  of  the  Registering  Officer  or  Registration  Department  to  check  all these  aspects.  The  role  of  the  Registrar  or  the  Department  is  very  limited  in  these aspects. The Registrar is empowered to verify certain issues but such power is limited and  he  cannot  undertake  roving  enquiries.  Therefore,  it  is  the  purchaser  who  must take  all  steps  and  precautions  to  record  all  the  recitals/covenants  properly  pertaining to  the  transaction  in  the  document;  and  get  it  regi
stered  as  per  the  provisions  of Registration  Act,  1908.  The  mistakes  in  documentati
on  may  result  in  civil  disputes and the parties have to undergo mental and physical strain besides incurring financial loss.  “A  stitch  in  time  saves  nine”  is  an  apt  phrase  for documentation.  Document  is the  final  product  of  the  transaction.  The  intent  and  objects  of  thetransaction  which may be part of mental design will go waste if you could not record properly the same by using proper and appropriate language/recitals in the document
Following   are   some   of   the   requirements   and   Precautions   in   document registration:
Attest   blanks,   erasures,   alterations:   If   there   are any   blanks,   erasures, 
interlineations and alterations in the document, the parties shall attest them with their signatures or initials. So, please check  whether there are any blanks, erasures,  etc; in the document which require attestation by the parties before submitting it to Registrar for registration.
Full and identifiable property description: Property shall be described with full details to identify the same without any ambiguity.In case of agriculture property, the survey  number  (old  and  new),  full  extent  of  survey number,  and  if  part  of  it  is transacted  then  all  the  four  boundaries  of  the  property,  extent  of  property  under transaction,  village  name,  panchayat  name,  mandal  name,  district  name  shall  bewritten  clearly.  The  details  like  pattadar  pass  book  and  title  deeds  may  also  be recorded  to  link  the  ownership  with  the  details  of property.  In  respect  of  house property,  the  details  like  door  number  (old  and  new), assessment  number  of  the property, street name, and village/city name shall 
be mentioned. In respect of vacant lands  situated  in  remote  places  the  property  descri
ption  requires  a  lot  more  caution and  effort.  The  people  are  cheated  by  fraudsters  by
  creating  multiple  documents  by selling  the  same  property  with  various  descriptions
. It  is  in  the  interest  of  the  buyer, the  description  of  property  must  be  full  and  comple
te.  It  is  better  to  avoid  vague description of boundaries like “neighbour’s property”. Make genuine efforts to know the current owners of the properties abutting the scheduled property and record in the document.  Property  description  is  heart  of  the  documentation  as  ultimately  the 
Registration Department converts these details intoindex particulars; and also uses to generate, Encumbrance  Certificate  (EC).  Accuracy  ofthese  details  will  result  in proper indexing and help people to know the registered transactions on the property.
Check  whether  property  is  Assigned/Government/  wakf/endowment  lands, etc.: Purchase or otherwise dealing with the government, assigned, wakf, endowment, scheduled areas (1 of 1970 Act) lands is prohibited and entails criminal proceedings. Therefore, it is advised to check and ensure that the property under transaction is not one of these lands.
Document shall be presented for registration with in four months from the date of  signing:  Document  other  than  will  deed  shall  be presented  for  registration  within four  months  from  signing  by  the  parties.  In  case  ofdelay  in  presenting  within  the stipulated  four months citing  unavoidable  circumstances  by  the  parties,  the  Registrar may  condone  the  delay  after  collecting  the  penalty.But  in  any  case,  the  delay  shall not  exceed  four  months.  That  means  a  document  shall be  presented  before  the concerned   Registering   Officer  for  registration  with in  four   months  without  any penalty;  and  within  eight  months  by  paying  penalty. But  no  document  shall  be accepted  for  registration  after  lapse  of  eight  months  from  the  date  of  signing (execution) by the parties. Therefore, the parties are advised to present the document before the Registering Officer concerned at the earliest possible day after execution of 
the document.
In respect of document executed outside India, thedocument can be presented for registration before the jurisdiction Registering Officer within four months after its arrival  in  India.  The  party  presenting  the  document may  have  to  prove  to  the satisfaction  of  the  Registering  Officer  that  the  document  was  received  in  India  on  a particular date with documentary evidence like cour
ier delivery receipt, affidavit from carrier of the document,etc.,
Will deeds can be presented at any time: There is no time limit to present will deeds.  A  will  can  be  presented  for  registration  even  after  50  years.  A  Will  can  be presented by the beneficiary/executor even after the death of the testator/testatrix. The Registering  Officer  will  conduct  enquiry  as  per  theprovisions  of  Registration  Act, and may register the will if he is satisfied that the will was properly executed  by the deceased testator.
Competent    Registrar/Sub    Registrar    Office:   Documents in    respect    of immovable  property  transactions  such  as  sale,  lease,  mortgage,  release,  partition, agreement/development   agreements   etc   shall   be   presented   to   the   jurisdiction 
Registrar/Sub  Registrar  Office  for  registration.  Party  shall  find  out  the  jurisdiction 
Registrar/Sub Registrar Office. Eg. Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Ward No.1 and 2 fall under the jurisdiction of Chikkadpalli Sub Registrar, whereas Ward Nos.3 to 5 falls under the jurisdiction of District Registrar,Hyderabad. If you want to register a sale  deed  pertaining  to  a  property  falling  under  Ward  No.3,  then  you  shall  go  to District Registrar, Hyderabad and present the document before the Joint Sub Registrar for its registration. If you are registering a property falling under Ward No.1 of MCH, then   either   you   may   present   the   document   before   jur
isdiction   Sub   Registrar, Chikkadpalli  or  you  may  present  the  same  before  the District  Registrar  (Joint  SR  I), Hyderabad  for  its  registration.  It  is  always  advisa
ble  to  get  the  documents  registered with  the  jurisdiction  Sub  Registrar.  Documents  othe
r  than  immovable  property transactions  like  movable  property  transactions,  affidavits,  etc.,  may  be  registered  in any Registrar/Sub Registrar Office.
Persons competent to present the document for registration: Person signing the document  is  called  executant  of  the  document.  The  executant  can  present  the document  for  registration.  If  there  is  more  than  one  executant  in  the  document,  then any one of the executants can present the document. But admission of execution shall be  done  by  all  the  executants.  The  claimant  (beneficiary)  may  also  present  the document. Any attested power of attorney holder may present the document. Attested power of attorney comes into picture when the docum
ent which shall be registered is actually signed by the principal but due to certain
 reasons, if the principal is not in a position  to  present  and  admit  the  execution  before 
the  Registering  Officer,  then  the 
principal  gives  the  power  to  the  agent  authorising 
him  to  present  and  admit  the 
execution  of  the  document,  which  the  principal  has 
signed.  This  power  requires 
attestation.  This  power  shall  be  attested  by  the  Su
b  Registrar  of  the  area  where  the 
principal  resides  if  he  is  in  India  where  Registrat
ion  Act,  1908  is  in  force.  If  the 
principal  resides  outside  India,  then  the  notary  pu
blic/Consul/Vice-Consul  of  India 
shall attest such power of attorney.
To  make it  clear,  once  again,  it  is  to  inform  tha
t the  attestation  is  required  in 
case  of  the  power  authorising  the  agent  to  present 
the  document  executed  by  the 
principal;  but  not  in  the  case  of  the  general  power
  of  attorney  which  authorises  the 
agent to sign on behalf of the principal. When the 
Agent signs the document on behalf 
of the Principal, he automatically becomes the exec
utant, so he presents the document 
in the capacity of executant
Such  general  power  of  attorney  is  optionally  regis
trable  document;  and  if 
parties  wish  to  get  it  registered,  they  can  get  it 
registered.  A  power  which  requires 
attestation, even though it is registered as per th
e provisions of Registration Act, 1908 
instead  of  attestation,  shall  not  be  accepted  by  th
e  Registrar/Sub  Registrar  as  it  is 
incurable defect.

eEncumbrance Statement
The long awaited dream, enabling the Citizens to search on their own the Encumbrance on any property registered in Sub Registrar Offices has been made a practical reality with the advent of Information Technology. Now citizens can search for Encumbrance on 24X7 basis from anywhere through the medium of Internet.
The Source for generating encumbrance details for self-search and encumbrance certificate obtained in Sub Registrar Office is same. Hence for all practical purposes both are same. However, citizens who need ink signed Encumbrance certificate should approach SRO concern.
Online eEC is available for transaction post 01-01-1983 only. Hence if citizens require Encumbrance certificate prior to 01-01-1983, they should approach SRO office concern.
Search for eEC can be made on :
Document Number and Year of Document OR
House Number or Old House Number or Apartment name situated in a City/ Town/Village with optional Flat Number and Colony/Locality/Habitation OR
Survey number in a Revenue Village and optionally described by a Plot number.
District and SRO office selection is mandatory under all options.
Period of search is controlled as per the availability of data.
Users are advised to enter the house number following the standard format as Ward - Block - Door NO / Bi no. for better results.
As the data describing the property is not well structured and standardized due to legacy data and variation in description of the same property with respect to time because of changes in the classification of property, a probabilistic search is made and that may result in display of multiple results some of which may not be of any interest to the user. User should select the relevant entry for generating the statement on Encumbrances.
Disclaimer:
The encumbrances shown in the eEC are those discovered with reference to the description of properties furnished by the applicants at the time of Registration.
All efforts are made for accuracy of data. However in case of any conflict, original data shall prevail.
In case system responds by “Data Not Found”, for confirmation approach SRO concern.

HINDU MARRIAGE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS AND PRECAUTIONs
Bride minimum age at the solemnisation of marriage – 18 years completed.
Bridegroom minimum age at the solemnisation of marriage - 21 years completed.
Wedding invitation card.
A photograph of marriage ceremony capturing both wife and husband.
Residential proof of either of the spouse.
Copies of SSC Certificates of wife and husband or passport copies (for Date 
of Birth proof).
Three witnesses to sign in the form.
Three witnesses to sign in the register of Registrar office.
Check  thrice  the  details  filled  in  the  Form  A.  Names  of  the  bride  and  groom  shall 
always  be  tallied  with  the  names  given  in  the  passport/SSC  and  other  certificates. 
Otherwise, at the time of issuance of visa and other certificates, you may have to face problem.
It  is  advisable  to  mention  the  name  of  the  wife  (bride)  before  and  after  marriage  at 
Sl.No.  1  of  the  Form  A.  Before  marriage,  the  surname  usually  belongs  to  father’s 
family.  And  after  marriage,  the  surname  of  the  husband’s  family  is  adopted.  So  it  is 
advisable, to mention two names as
name (before marriage), and   name (after marriage).
Eg. Wife (bride) name before marriage – Akaram Kumari;
Check  the  certificate  issued  by  the  Sub  Registrar  office  and  if  there  are  any 
discrepancies in the names or any other details, immediately bring them to the notice of the Sub Registrar and get them rectified.
In case of any discrepancy in the details found subsequently in the marriage certificate issued by the Sub Registrar, there is a cumbersome procedure involved to get rectify 
such discrepancies.
The Marriage can be registered either –
At the Sub Registrar Office where the marriage venu
e is situated,
At the Sub Registrar Office in whose jurisdiction either wife or husband has been residing for at least six months immediately preceding the date of marriage.
Registrar  may  attend  the  marriage  ceremony  in  person  and  register  the  same  if  he  is 
requested to do so by submitting all the papers, prescribed fee in advance, if it (time) is convenient to him.
It  is  advised  to  take all the  precautions  and  thorough  check  of  the  documents  during 
marriage registration itself.
Rule   relating   to   marriage   registration   under   Hindu Marriage   Act   is   extracted 
hereunder:
An  application  for  the  registration  of  a  Hindu  Marriage,  shall  be  in Form 'A' and shall be signed by each party to the marriage or by the guardian of  such  party  and  shall  be  presented  in  person  before  the  Registrar  in  whose jurisdiction  the  marriage  is  solemnized  or  before  the  Registrar  in  whose jurisdiction  either  party  to  the  marriage  has  been 
residing  for  at  least  six months immediately preceding the date of marriage.
For  better  understanding  of  the  statutory  position,the  relevant  portion  of  Hindu 
Marriage Act, 1955 is given below:
Section 5. Conditions for a Hindu marriage
A marriage may be solemnised between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfilled, namely:-
neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage;
at  the  time  of  the  marriage,  neither  party- is  incapable  of  giving  a  valid consent to it in consequence of unsoundness of mind
; or
though  capable  of  giving  a  valid  consent,  has  been suffering  from  mental 
disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of children;
has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity o
r epilepsy;
the bridegroom has completed the age of twenty one years and the bride, the age of eighteen years at the time of the marriage;
the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two;
the parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two.

Q2. WHO IS A PERSON OF INDIAN ORIGIN?
For the purposes of availing of the facilities of opening and maintenance of bank accounts and investments in shares/securities in India:
A foreign citizen (other than a citizen of Pakistan or Bangladesh) is deemed to be of Indian origin, if,

Overseas Corporate Bodies (OCBs) are bodies predominantly owned by individuals of Indian nationality or origin resident outside India and include overseas companies, partnership firms, societies and other corporate bodies which are owned, directly or indirectly, to the extent of at least 60% by individuals of Indian nationality or origin resident outside India as also overseas trusts in which at least 60% of the beneficial interest is irrevocably held by such persons. Such ownership interest should be actually held by them and not in the capacity as nominees. The various facilities granted to
			  NRIs are also available with certain exceptions to OCBs as long as the ownership/beneficial interest held in them by NRIs continues to be at least 60%.
Q4. ARE OCBS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE ANY CERTIFICATE REGARDING OWNERSHIP/BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN THEM BY NRIS?
In order to establish that the ownership/beneficial interest in any OCB held by NRIs is not less than 60%, the concerned body/trust is required to initially furnish a certificate from an overseas auditor/chartered accountant/certified public 
			  accountant in form OAC where the ownership/beneficial interest is directly held by NRIs, and in form OAC 1 where it is held indirectly by NRIs and further that such ownership interest is actually held by them and not in the capacity as nominees. Thereafter a simple certificate signed by the Managing Director or Chief Executive Officers of the OCB on the lines indicated above may be submitted.

(a) As defined under Sec.47A of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, market value of property is the value it would fetch if sold in the open market.
(b) Government has formed Committees to estimate market value of properties. They would survey and enquire regarding values of different localities in open market. They would collect the data from different sources like open auctions conducted by HUDA and other urban development authorities, Banks, Financial Institutions, registered documents reflecting real consideration, land acquisition compensation, etc. The committee will estimate the value from time to time as per laid down norms and principles and publish the same for information of public. The committees after hearing the objections, if any from the public will modify/amend the proposals or if they found the objections are unfounded, then they may go ahead to approve the proposed values. We have urban and rural committees to fix market values. Revenue Department, Municipal, ZillaParishad, Registration Department officials are part of this committee. From the year 2010, the market value guidelines registers are being published and sold through Sub Registrar and District Registrar Offices.
(c) When a document is presented to the Sub Registrar for registration, he will give market value slip in prescribed form about the market value of property. If the party concerned agrees to pay the stamp duty on such value, he will register the document.
(d) If parties to the document do not agree to pay stamp duty on the market value informed as above, the Sub Registrar will keep the document pending and refer the matter for determination of market value after collecting 50% of the deficit stamp duty as a deposit to refer it to the Collector (District Registrar) under Section 47A

(f) Appeal may be preferred to the Civil Court within 60 days from the date of receipt of order of the District Registrar.
Q19. IS THERE PROVISION TO GET REFUND OF VALUE OF STAMP PAPERS NOT USED OR SPOILED ETC?
Yes, there is a provision to refund of value of NJ Stamp papers not used or spoiled under Indian Stamp Act, 1899. But in the State of Telangana, the NJ Stamp papers are available upto Rs.100/ - denomination only. Therefore, this provision serves no better purpose. But, the Government of issued a G.O., allowing refund of the. amounts paid through challan system. A copy of the G.O., may be seen
by clicking here....
Q20. IS THERE ANY TIME LIMIT FOR THE USAGE OF THE STAMP PAPERS PURCHASED?
Q21. HOW TO PREVENT USE OF FAKE STAMPS?
In Telangana State, sale of Non - judicial stamp papers is restricted to the denomination maximum of Rs.100/ -. Therefore, in a way, the Government has checked effectively the circulation of fake stamps by sale of the stamps from only authorized/licenced Stamp Vendors or from Government Offices (Sub Registrar and District Registrar Offices)/(postoffices). Remaining stamp duty can be paid through challan.
Q22. WHAT IS THE STAMP DUTY AND RE GISTRATION FEE PAYABLE FOR PARTITION AMONG JOINT FAMILY? ?
0.5% stamp duty to a maximum of Rs.20,000/- on the market value of the value of separated share. Example: If there are three parties by name A,B and C in a partition deed, Party by name A got Rs.500000/ - value of property. Party B got Rs.400000/ - and Party C got Rs.300000/ - . Now, the parties have to pay the stamp duty on the value of separate share means on Rs.4 and 3 lakhs exempting Rs.5 lakh. A stamp duty of Rs.3,500/ - has to be paid on this instrument of partition. In case all the shares are of equal value, then one share has to be exempted from calculation to levy stamp duty.

Q38. WHAT IS MEANT BY ENCUMBRANCE CERTIFICATE (EC)?
Encumbrance Certificate is a record showing registered transactions pertaining to a property. If mortgage, sale or any other deeds in respect of an immovable property are registered, indexing will be done by the Registration Department and this indexing is ultimately converted to generate an encumbrance certificate. Today, in Telangana, the Encumbrance Certificates are issued by MeeSeva Centres and Sub Registrar and District Registrar Offices.
Q39. WHAT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD BY NIL EC ?
?
If no deeds of transactions are registered in respect of a property mentioned in the application of EC, nil encumbrance certificate is issued. 
			  If Certificate is issued in this form, it means that there are no registered transactions / liabilities on the property for a given period of time; 
			  and unregistered transactions are not included in this certificate since such details are not available with Registration Department. People shall be 
			  very careful in filling the application form for EC; if they give incomplete/inaccurate details, they may get a wrong EC. Interested parties may approach 
			  the Sub Registrar and on paying prescribed fee, may be permitted to verify the records personally. EC cannot be taken as a sole criterion to buy a property
			  or lend money. 
			  It is better to undertake comprehensive study as suggested in property purchase precautions or Jagrattha short film on the website.
Q40. HOW TO OBTAIN CERTIFIED COPY OF A REGISTERED DOCUMENT?
Any person may obtain certified copy of registered document relating to immovable property.
Certified copy of registered will, may be obtained only by the testator only during his lifetime. Any person may get copy of a will after the death of the testator on production of death certificate.

It  is  advisable  to  mention  the  name  of  the  wife  (br

e  usually  belongs  to  father’s 
family.  And  after  marriage,  the  surname  of  the  husb
and’s  family  is  adopted.  So  it  is 
advisable, to mention two names as
name (before marriage), and   name (after marriage
).
Eg. Wife (bride) name before marriage – Akaram Kum
ari;  
 Wife (bride) name after marriage – Vennem Kumari (

mediately bring them to the notice

procedure involved to get rectify 
such discrepancies.

e is situated,

ither wife or husband has 
been residing for at least six months immediately p
receding the date of 
marriage.
Registrar  may  attend  the  marriage  ceremony  in  perso
n  and  register  the  same  if  he  is 
requested to do so by submitting all the papers, pr
escribed fee in advance, if it (time) 
is convenient to him.
It  is  advised  to  take all the  precautions  and  thoro
ugh  check  of  the  documents  during 
marriage registration itself.
Rule   relating   to   marriage   registration   under   Hindu 
Marriage   Act   is   extracted 
hereunder:
5.  (1)  An  application  for  the  registration  of  a  Hi
ndu  Marriage,  shall  be  in 
Form 'A' and shall be signed by each party to the m
arriage or by the guardian 
of  such  party  and  shall  be  presented  in  person  befo
re  the  Registrar  in  whose 
jurisdiction  the  marriage  is  solemnized  or  before  t
he  Registrar  in  whose 
jurisdiction  either  party  to  the  marriage  has  been 
residing  for  at  least  six 
months immediately preceding the date of marriage.
For  better  understanding  of  the  statutory  position,
  the  relevant  portion  of  Hindu 
Marriage Act, 1955 is given below:

; or
though  capable  of  giving  a  valid  consent,  has  been 
suffering  from  mental 
disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to 
be unfit for marriage and the 
procreation of children; or
has been subject to recurrent attacks of insanity o
r epilepsy;
the bridegroom has completed the age of twenty one 
years and the bride, the 
age of eighteen years at the time of the marriage;

DOCUMENT REGISTRATION - REQUIREMENTS AND PRECAUTION
The  Transfer  of  Property  Act  1882  and  Registration Act,  1908  prescribe 
compulsory registration of certain documents. Transfer of Property Act mandates that certain documents  to  be  valid;  they  should  give  “notice  to  the  world”.  Registration Act,  1908  gives  the  mechanism  to  the  concept  of  “notice  to  the  world”.  The documents registered in Book 1 of Registration Offices are public documents, so any public may inspect such book; get copies of the sam
e and a list of details of registered documents   chronologically   in   the   shape   of   an   Encumb
rance   Certificate   (EC). Documents   affecting   immovable   property   through   sale,   gift,   partition,   release, mortgage, lease, sale agreement are some of the compulsorily registerable documents. Registration  Act  is  one  of  the  oldest  legislations made  during  pre-Independence 
period  that  are  being  implemented  in  almost all parts  of the country  without  altering 
substantially  for  the  last  200  years.  Records  containing  the  copies  of  registered 
documents in Registration Offices are permanent in nature (philosophically speaking they  have  to  be  preserved  for  eternity);  therefore,  record  preservation  is  one  of  the prime  objectives  of  the  Registration  Department.  Civil  courts  heavily  depend  on  the records  of  Registration  Department  in  deciding  the issues  like  title,  ownership, possession of immovable properties.
Majority  of  parties  invariably  approach  solicitors,  advocates  or  professional document writers to get their documents prepared; and, at times, also for registration. But, it is better to know some of the important aspects of document and its registration so  as  to  check  whether  the  person  who  is  entrusted with  its  preparation  and registration is acting properly.
One must know that the Transfer of Property Act and other civil laws in India keep  the  onus  on  the  purchaser/beneficiary  under  the  document  to  take  all  the responsibility  of  verification  of  the  title,  ownership,  possession  of  property.  It  is  not the  responsibility  of  the  Registering  Officer  or  Registration  Department  to  check  all these  aspects.  The  role  of  the  Registrar  or  the  Department  is  very  limited  in  these aspects. The Registrar is empowered to verify certain issues but such power is limited and  he  cannot  undertake  roving  enquiries.  Therefore,  it  is  the  purchaser  who  must take  all  steps  and  precautions  to  record  all  the  recitals/covenants  properly  pertaining to  the  transaction  in  the  document;  and  get  it  regi
stered  as  per  the  provisions  of Registration  Act,  1908.  The  mistakes  in  documentati
on  may  result  in  civil  disputes and the parties have to undergo mental and physical strain besides incurring financial loss.  “A  stitch  in  time  saves  nine”  is  an  apt  phrase  for documentation.  Document  is the  final  product  of  the  transaction.  The  intent  and  objects  of  thetransaction  which may be part of mental design will go waste if you could not record properly the same by using proper and appropriate language/recitals in the document
Following   are   some   of   the   requirements   and   Precautions   in   document registration:
Attest   blanks,   erasures,   alterations:   If   there   are any   blanks,   erasures, 
interlineations and alterations in the document, the parties shall attest them with their signatures or initials. So, please check  whether there are any blanks, erasures,  etc; in the document which require attestation by the parties before submitting it to Registrar for registration.
Full and identifiable property description: Property shall be described with full details to identify the same without any ambiguity.In case of agriculture property, the survey  number  (old  and  new),  full  extent  of  survey number,  and  if  part  of  it  is transacted  then  all  the  four  boundaries  of  the  property,  extent  of  property  under transaction,  village  name,  panchayat  name,  mandal  name,  district  name  shall  bewritten  clearly.  The  details  like  pattadar  pass  book  and  title  deeds  may  also  be recorded  to  link  the  ownership  with  the  details  of property.  In  respect  of  house property,  the  details  like  door  number  (old  and  new), assessment  number  of  the property, street name, and village/city name shall 
be mentioned. In respect of vacant lands  situated  in  remote  places  the  property  descri
ption  requires  a  lot  more  caution and  effort.  The  people  are  cheated  by  fraudsters  by
  creating  multiple  documents  by selling  the  same  property  with  various  descriptions
. It  is  in  the  interest  of  the  buyer, the  description  of  property  must  be  full  and  comple
te.  It  is  better  to  avoid  vague description of boundaries like “neighbour’s property”. Make genuine efforts to know the current owners of the properties abutting the scheduled property and record in the document.  Property  description  is  heart  of  the  documentation  as  ultimately  the 
Registration Department converts these details intoindex particulars; and also uses to generate, Encumbrance  Certificate  (EC).  Accuracy  ofthese  details  will  result  in proper indexing and help people to know the registered transactions on the property.
Check  whether  property  is  Assigned/Government/  wakf/endowment  lands, etc.: Purchase or otherwise dealing with the government, assigned, wakf, endowment, scheduled areas (1 of 1970 Act) lands is prohibited and entails criminal proceedings. Therefore, it is advised to check and ensure that the property under transaction is not one of these lands.
Document shall be presented for registration with in four months from the date of  signing:  Document  other  than  will  deed  shall  be presented  for  registration  within four  months  from  signing  by  the  parties.  In  case  ofdelay  in  presenting  within  the stipulated  four months citing  unavoidable  circumstances  by  the  parties,  the  Registrar may  condone  the  delay  after  collecting  the  penalty.But  in  any  case,  the  delay  shall not  exceed  four  months.  That  means  a  document  shall be  presented  before  the concerned   Registering   Officer  for  registration  with in  four   months  without  any penalty;  and  within  eight  months  by  paying  penalty. But  no  document  shall  be accepted  for  registration  after  lapse  of  eight  months  from  the  date  of  signing (execution) by the parties. Therefore, the parties are advised to present the document before the Registering Officer concerned at the earliest possible day after execution of 
the document.
In respect of document executed outside India, thedocument can be presented for registration before the jurisdiction Registering Officer within four months after its arrival  in  India.  The  party  presenting  the  document may  have  to  prove  to  the satisfaction  of  the  Registering  Officer  that  the  document  was  received  in  India  on  a particular date with documentary evidence like cour
ier delivery receipt, affidavit from carrier of the document,etc.,
Will deeds can be presented at any time: There is no time limit to present will deeds.  A  will  can  be  presented  for  registration  even  after  50  years.  A  Will  can  be presented by the beneficiary/executor even after the death of the testator/testatrix. The Registering  Officer  will  conduct  enquiry  as  per  theprovisions  of  Registration  Act, and may register the will if he is satisfied that the will was properly executed  by the deceased testator.
Competent    Registrar/Sub    Registrar    Office:   Documents in    respect    of immovable  property  transactions  such  as  sale,  lease,  mortgage,  release,  partition, agreement/development   agreements   etc   shall   be   presented   to   the   jurisdiction 
Registrar/Sub  Registrar  Office  for  registration.  Party  shall  find  out  the  jurisdiction 
Registrar/Sub Registrar Office. Eg. Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Ward No.1 and 2 fall under the jurisdiction of Chikkadpalli Sub Registrar, whereas Ward Nos.3 to 5 falls under the jurisdiction of District Registrar,Hyderabad. If you want to register a sale  deed  pertaining  to  a  property  falling  under  Ward  No.3,  then  you  shall  go  to District Registrar, Hyderabad and present the document before the Joint Sub Registrar for its registration. If you are registering a property falling under Ward No.1 of MCH, then   either   you   may   present   the   document   before   jur
isdiction   Sub   Registrar, Chikkadpalli  or  you  may  present  the  same  before  the District  Registrar  (Joint  SR  I), Hyderabad  for  its  registration.  It  is  always  advisa
ble  to  get  the  documents  registered with  the  jurisdiction  Sub  Registrar.  Documents  othe
r  than  immovable  property transactions  like  movable  property  transactions,  affidavits,  etc.,  may  be  registered  in any Registrar/Sub Registrar Office.
Persons competent to present the document for registration: Person signing the document  is  called  executant  of  the  document.  The  executant  can  present  the document  for  registration.  If  there  is  more  than  one  executant  in  the  document,  then any one of the executants can present the document. But admission of execution shall be  done  by  all  the  executants.  The  claimant  (beneficiary)  may  also  present  the document. Any attested power of attorney holder may present the document. Attested power of attorney comes into picture when the docum
ent which shall be registered is actually signed by the principal but due to certain
 reasons, if the principal is not in a position  to  present  and  admit  the  execution  before 
the  Registering  Officer,  then  the 
principal  gives  the  power  to  the  agent  authorising 
him  to  present  and  admit  the 
execution  of  the  document,  which  the  principal  has 
signed.  This  power  requires 
attestation.  This  power  shall  be  attested  by  the  Su
b  Registrar  of  the  area  where  the 
principal  resides  if  he  is  in  India  where  Registrat
ion  Act,  1908  is  in  force.  If  the 
principal  resides  outside  India,  then  the  notary  pu
blic/Consul/Vice-Consul  of  India 
shall attest such power of attorney.
To  make it  clear,  once  again,  it  is  to  inform  tha
t the  attestation  is  required  in 
case  of  the  power  authorising  the  agent  to  present 
the  document  executed  by  the 
principal;  but  not  in  the  case  of  the  general  power
  of  attorney  which  authorises  the 
agent to sign on behalf of the principal. When the 
Agent signs the document on behalf 
of the Principal, he automatically becomes the exec
utant, so he presents the document 
in the capacity of executant
Such  general  power  of  attorney  is  optionally  regis
trable  document;  and  if 
parties  wish  to  get  it  registered,  they  can  get  it 
registered.  A  power  which  requires 
attestation, even though it is registered as per th
e provisions of Registration Act, 1908 
instead  of  attestation,  shall  not  be  accepted  by  th
e  Registrar/Sub  Registrar  as  it  is 
incurable defect.

రిజిష్ట్రేషన్ మరియు స్టాంప్స్ శాఖ
రిజిష్ట్రేషన్ మరియు స్టాంప్స్ శాఖ, ప్రభుత్వ యంత్రాగము యొక్క విభాగములో పురాతనమైనది. ఇది 1864 సంవత్సరము నుండి ప్రజలకు సంబంధితమైన శాఖా పరమైన సేవలను అందించుచున్నది. విస్తృత స్ధాయిలో రిజిష్టర్డ్ డాక్యుమెంట్ అనగా (సమాచారము నమోదు కాబడిన దస్తావేజు) ఖచ్ఛితమైన నమోదు కాబడిని సమాచారమునకు సూచికగా చలామణి అగుచున్నది. స్ధిరాస్ధుల గురించి వివరములు మరియు నమోదు, హక్కులు, తప్పనిసరిగా చేయబడవలసిని అంశములు మరియు హక్కు ( టైటిల్) మొదలగునవి ప్రజలు తెలుసుకొనటకుగాను ఏదేని విషయ సంగ్రహణకు ఇట్టి రిజిష్టర్డ్ డాక్కుమెంట్స్ ప్రయోజనకారిగా ఉన్నవి. తదుపరి ఈ శాఖ గత 150 సంవత్సరముల నుండి రిజిష్టర్డ్ దస్తావేజుల సమాచారమునకు భద్రత కల్పిస్తున్నది. ఈ శాఖ వివిధ ప్రయోజనముల నిమిత్తము, ఇట్టి దస్తావేజుల ప్రతులు, నకళ్లు ప్రజల అభ్యర్ధనల మేరకు మరియు న్యాయస్ధానములనందు వ్యాజ్యములకు అవసరమని భావించినపుడు శుధ్దత లేదా సత్య నిరూపణకు ఉపయోగపడుచున్నవి.
రిజిష్ట్రేషన్ మరియు స్టాంప్స్ శాఖ స్టాంప్ డ్యూటీ మరియు రిజిష్ట్రేషన్ రుసుము సేకరించుట ద్వారా రాష్ట్ర ప్రభుత్వ ఖజానాకు ఆదాయమును సమకూర్చుచున్నది. ప్రస్తుతము, రిజిష్ట్రేషన్ మరియు స్టాంప్స్ శాఖ, రాష్ట్ర ప్రభుత్వ ఖజానాకు అత్యధిక ఆదాయమును సమకూర్చు శాఖల జాబితా నందు మూడవ స్ధానములో ఉన్నది. ఈ శాఖ, దస్తావేజుల రిజిష్ట్రేషన్ లేదా నమోదు సమయములో, అట్టి దస్తావేజుల స్వభావమును అనుసరించి కొన్ని నిర్ధిష్టమైన, ప్రత్యేకమయిన దస్తావేజుల పైన ఆస్తుల బదిలీ పన్ను వసూలు చేయును. ఈ విధముగా వసూలు కాబడిని బదిలీ పన్ను స్ధానిక సంస్ధలకు కేటాయింపు చేయును. దీనితో పాటు ఈ శాఖ, హిందు వివాహముల, ప్రత్యేక వివాహముల రిజిష్ట్రేషన్, సొసైటీల ( సంఘముల) రిజిష్ట్రేషన్ మరియు సంఘముల కార్యకలాపాలను నమోదు చేయుట మరియు భాగస్వామ్య సంస్ధల రిజిష్ట్రేషన్ చేయుచున్ననది. వినియోగదారుల ప్రయోజనాల దృష్ట్యా రాష్ట్రములోని చిట్-ఫండ్ సంప్ధల ఆర్ధిక కార్యకలాపాలను క్రమబద్దీకరణ చేయుచున్నది.

About Departement
The Registration and Stamps Department is age old department functioning way back from the year 1864. The object of the department is to give publicity to the registered documents. Registration of a document is a notice to the public by way of definite recorded information to the world at large to enable public to verify the records and enquire therefrom the right, title and obligations if any on any immovable property. Further the department is acting as a "Royal record keeper", by preserving age old records and providing copies of the records held by it to provide as proof of genuineness in the Court of Law.
The department is collecting revenue to the State exchequer by way of Stamp Duty, Transfer Duty and Registration Fees. At present the department is the third largest revenue earning department in the state of Telangana.
