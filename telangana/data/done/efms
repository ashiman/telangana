Village Organization
The second tier of Institution Building is the federation of SHGs either at Village/cluster of village's level. The VO operates as a forum to voice the problems of the poor in the village and raises resources required to take up the appropriate development interventions in poverty reduction. The general body of VO comprises of all SHG members in the VO operational area and the Executive committee (EC ) comprises of the first leaders of the member SHGs. The VO will have 3 to 5 office bearers for carrying out the day-today functions and representing the VO in various forums/institutions. The VO will conduct its EC meeting at least once in a month and the general body meeting at least once in three months. The functional committees derived from VO EC viz., POP & SHG monitoring committee, CIF & Audit committee, Bank-linkages & Insurance committee, land, CMSA, Dairy and collective marketing committee, jobs & non-farm activities committee and social development issues committee will ensure the effective implementation of various services rendered by VOs. Based on the scale of operations every VO appoints its own VO Bookkeeper, Community activist and para-professionals.

SHGs
SHGs are small homogenous groups. 10 to 20 members from similar socio-economic conditions come together and form a group on the basis of self-selection process at the village level. The SHGs would conduct either weekly or fortnightly or monthly meetings on a scheduled day, time and place. The members save either on weekly or fortnightly or monthly basis in the SHGs and disburse need-based loans to members from their savings amounts. The SHGs access external loans either from Commercial banks or VOs when there is a deficit of funds for financing Micro Credit Plans of members. Each SHG elect/select two or three office bearers who's primarily responsibilities include facilitation of various activities at group level, representing the group in different forums and signing on the cheques. The group's capacity is also built and facilitated, so that they have their own bookkeeper to write the books of accounts of the group. The self-paid bookkeeper is an important prerequisite to the sustainability of the group in long run. Apart from financial activities, SHGs would also identify various social issues viz., dowry, untouchability, child labour etc and discuss in their regular meetings. With support of Village Organization, the SHGs will take active role in dealing social issues and community development activities.

SHGs
SHGs are small homogenous groups. 10 to 20 members from similar socio-economic conditions come together and form a group on the basis of self-selection process at the village level. The SHGs would conduct either weekly or fortnightly or monthly meetings on a scheduled day, time and place. The members save either on weekly or fortnightly or monthly basis in the SHGs and disburse need-based loans to members from their savings amounts. The SHGs access external loans either from Commercial banks or VOs when there is a deficit of funds for financing Micro Credit Plans of members. Each SHG elect/select two or three office bearers who's primarily responsibilities include facilitation of various activities at group level, representing the group in different forums and signing on the cheques. The group's capacity is also built and facilitated, so that they have their own bookkeeper to write the books of accounts of the group. The self-paid bookkeeper is an important prerequisite to the sustainability of the group in long run. Apart from financial activities, SHGs would also identify various social issues viz., dowry, untouchability, child labour etc and discuss in their regular meetings. With support of Village Organization, the SHGs will take active role in dealing social issues and community development activities.

The VO will have 3 to 5 office bearers for carrying out the day-today functions and representing the VO in various forums/institutions.
