Education is a process of human enlightenment and empowerment for the achievement of a better and higher quality of life. A sound and effective system of education results in the unfolding of learner potentialities, enlargement of competencies, transformation of interests, attitudes and values.
Teachers play an important role in the lives of learners through the process of education. If teachers acquire professional competencies, commitment and are enabled and empowered to perform multiple tasks in the class room, school and community in a genuinely professional manner, then a chain reaction begins starting with sound teacher performance culminating into high quality class room in school education.
Effective teacher education becomes a core condition to ensure high proficiency and quality in school education. Effective school education anticipates effective teacher education. An unprofessional teacher could cause lasting damage to the very growth and development of the child. An empathetic teacher can nurture a child into a sensitive human being. If the same child is mishandled, he /she might grow into a violent and aggressive youth.   The social, emotional and psychological components of teaching and learning are extremely significant for each and every child and hence for the nation in turn.
Teacher Education is nurturing of creativity, inculcation of commitment and generation of a strong will to contribute at the highest level of efficiency through a value-based approach. The teacher education institutes in the state - S.C.E.R.T, I.A.S.E, C.T.Es and DIETs should unearth the treasure within every teacher and subsequently within every learner and make the individuals realize the magnitude and potentialities which if nurtured and inculcated in the right direction, could make significant contribution to the identified sectors.
Teacher Education continued to be an insignificant component of Elementary and Secondary Education right from first to seventh five year plans.  From Eighth Plan onwards i.e., NPE 1986 has provided a fillip to teacher education by way of creation of special institutes at Elementary and Secondary levels along with providing necessary resources for infrastructure and staff resources.
DIETs have been established as a part of NPE 1986 for providing pre-service and in-service education at District level as a part of major quality initiative at Elementary stage. Further IASEs and CTEs have been visualized and established as a part of strengthening of Teacher Education at Secondary level along with professional development of Teacher Educators.  Sufficient funds have been provided for their establishment and to make a beginning to take up quality initiatives during VIII and IX Plan periods.
