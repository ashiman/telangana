"T-Fiber is envisioned to establish a state of the art network  infrastructure to facilitate the realization of ‘Digital Telangana’"
A screen reader is a software application that enables people with severe visual impairments to use a computer. Screen readers work closely with the computer’s Operating System (OS) to provide information about icons, menus, dialogue boxes, files and folders. A screen reader provides access to the entire OS that it works with, including many common applications.
A screen reader uses a Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine to translate on-screen information into speech, which can be heard through earphones or speakers. A TTS may be a software application that comes bundled with the screen reader, or it may be a hardware device that plugs into the computer. Originally, before computers had soundcards, screen readers always used hardware TTS devices, but now that soundcards come as standard on all computers many find that a software TTS is preferable. In addition to speech feedback, screen readers are also capable of providing information in Braille. An external hardware device, known as a refreshable Braille display is needed for this. A refreshable Braille display contains one or more rows of cells. Each cell can be formed into the shape of a Braille character, a series of dots that are similar to domino dots in their layout. As the information on the computer screen changes, so does the Braille characters on the display change, providing refreshable information directly from the computer. Whilst it is possible to use either format independently, Braille output is commonly used in conjunction with speech output.

Telangana Fiber Grid (T-Fiber) project, aimed at providing Internet connection to every household in Telangana, will be completed by mid-2018, state IT Minister K T Rama Rao said today.
“We are laying 47,000 kms of fiber optic network, (which is) in addition to BharatNet programme. We are laying optical fiber cables along with ‘Mission Bhagiratha’ pipelines to provide drinking water,” Rao said at an event here.
Telangana Fiber Grid (T-Fiber) is envisioned to establish a state-of-the-art network infrastructure to facilitate the realisation of ‘Digital Telangana’ objective by piggybacking on Drinking Water Project – Mission Bhagiratha.
“By the middle of next year, Telangana will not only be the first state in the country to be giving potable drinking water connection to each and every house, but will also be the first in the country to be giving a broadband internet connection,” the minister said.
“Once you have every home wired, the possibilities are numerous. Health, education, commerce opportunities that it can unleash are manifold. T-Fiber programme will be completed by mid-2018,” Rao said.
He further said that the government is mulling to set up digital libraries at the heritage structures in Hyderabad.
IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said 3,000 public locations have been identified to create Wi-Fi hotspots in public places in Hyderabad and next month this Wi-Fi programme will be launched. “Typically, it will take around four-six months to cover 3,000 hot spots,” he said.

Hyderabad: Telangana Fiber Grid programme is all set to a get a fresh boost with the Central government signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Telangana State government and allotting Rs 1,243 crore under Phase-II of BharatNet programme which is a hi-speed rural broadband network. Principal Secretary for IT and Industries Jayesh Ranjan and Telangana Fiber Grid Corporation managing director Sujai Karampuri signed the MoU on behalf of Telangana State.
The MoUs were signed during the national conference on ‘BharatNet’ for launch of Phase-II in New Delhi on 13th November,2017 in the presence of Union Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar, Union Minister of State for Communication Manoj Sinha, and other top dignitaries.
Under the Phase-II, the government will establish fiber optic cables connecting mandals to gram panchayats covering 6,657 gram panchayats across Telangana State. A part of total Rs 1,243 crore will be released as advance to enable faster implementation.
Speaking on the occasion, Ravi Shankar Prasad described the launch of Phase II as a turning point to bring digital revolution that would bridge the digital divide between rural and urban India. Manoj Sinha cited the example of Telangana State which used the same trenches of Mission Bhagiratha to lay fiber optic duct and cable, and urged other States to emulate Telangana State in using multiple utilities to bring synergy in costing, implementation and maintenance.
BharatNet is a project initiated by the Union government and funded by the Universal Service Obligation Fund with the aim of providing broadband connectivity to over 2.5 lakh gram panchayats in the country. Under Phase-I, about 2.4 lakh km of optical fiber cable has already been laid connecting 1.4 lakh gram panchayats across the country.

Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development K.T.Rama Rao stressed that the water pipelines of Mission Bhagiratha should be accompanied by optic fibre lines laid under the Telangana Fiber Grid (T-Fiber) scheme so that the internet penetration would be a reality for all towns and cities in the state.
At a review meeting here on Friday, Mr.Rama Rao asked the officials to prepare financial estimates for the proposal.
The T-Fiber project needs coordination between Municipal and Information Technology departments, he said, asked them to form a joint working group. Wherever there is no need to disturb the existing pipeline network, the optic fiber lines need to be laid separately.
He asked officials to prepare digital maps of the internet cable network along with the pipeline network. Cost for the ducts required for accommodating both the lines will be borne by the government, and the same will be undertaken in writing by the Engineer in Chief (Public Health), he said.
Referring to a meeting organised with Municipal Engineering department (Public Health) officials and working agencies on the same day, Mr. Rama Rao said CC cameras will be installed in all corporation for effective monitoring of the city. Special funds have been allotted to all cities for the purpose.
The review meeting has been held on the preparedness of the Municipal Administration for the urban Mission Bhageeratha.
Officials have apprised the minister on the structures, planning, and funding, besides the city-wise break up of works.
The Minister has asked the officials to make efforts to complete the project by next June.
Higher officials from Municipal Administration and representatives of the contract agencies participated in the meeting, a press statement informed.

Ravi Shankar Prasad, Union Minister for Electronics & IT along with KT Rama Rao, IT Minister of Telangana launch TDN
T-Fiber is the government’s initiative to establish infrastructure to enable affordable, high speed broadband connectivity and digital services to 10 Zones (31 Districts), 584 Mandals, 8,778 Gram Panchayats, 10,128 villages, 83.58 lakh households and more than 3.5 crore people. The state will be investing Rs 5,500 crore into the project.
“We are building one of the densest and fastest broadband networks called T-Fibre with a vision to achieve 100% penetration. Through T-Fibre, we aim to provide each and every household of Telangana with optical fibre cable connectivity. We aim to provide government-to-citizen and government-to-government services very effectively with state-of-the-art infrastructure,” KT Rama Rao, Minister of IT for Telangana said.
The Optic Fiber for the program is being laid alongside the state government’s drinking water pipeline project Mission Bhagiratha. Separate ducts are being laid alongside the water pipelines, helping reduce the expenditure.
“With T-Fiber, we are creating an optic fiber highway to enable all gram panchayats to have high speed connectivity. For example, gram panchayats don’t have Mee Seva centres due to lack of connectivity. So we are connecting all government services through this and delivering it to citizens,” said Anand Kasula, project head, T-Fiber.
The project also aims to connect households, which will enable them to make online payments and use other online services, provide them with set up boxes so that they have access to live government TV channels.
T-Fiber, which is currently being piloted in four villages in Telangana, will be extended to all 8,778 gram panchayats by December 2018. The four villages are Maheshwaram, Thummuluru, Mansanpally and Sirigiripuram. The government has invested Rs 13 crore in the pilot project.
In Maheshwaram, which has a Public Health Centre (PHC), the government is piloting telemedicine where the PHC works with super specialty doctors of Apollo Hospitals through video conferencing. In cases that cannot be diagnosed by the local PHC, patient data is shared with the doctor at Apollo and both doctors together diagnose and treat the patient. The same is being piloted in Mansanpally as well.
In Thummuluru, the government is piloting e-learning services where students in schools can be taught and trained by qualified teachers through video conferencing. It is also piloting a kiosk with Sterlite Tech. This kiosk helps residents of the village with all computing needs in a single device. It allows villagers to make video calls, attend training sessions using Virtual Reality where anyone from across the country can train them. The kiosk allows controlling of street lights, has sensors to help villagers know the soil moisture, temperature, humidity and other such factors.
The kiosk also allows them to send an email using a speech to text technology, which allows them to speak in Telugu as well. It also prints land records, receipts and allows interaction with Aadhaar system.
Other services such as e-agriculture, banking, Mee Seva, security surveillance, panchayat services are also being offered. It is also looking at monetisation services such as telephone connection, broadband internet, cable TV, cellular operators and IPTV services.
It has also partnered with several large corporates that are helping deliver services to the residents of the gram panchayats, similar to the kiosk powered by Sterlite Tech.
“We are making the infrastructure and any player can demonstrate their services. We are keeping this network for a year for anyone to showcase their services. Services, apps, etc can be integrated,” Anand says.
Some of the service partners apart from Sterlite Tech are HP Enterprise, Cisco, Corpus, Celkon, D-Link, Micromax, Nokia, Cisco.
The idea is to build on the digital India mission and connect all villages and gram panchayats of the state using optic fiber and offer them high speed broadband network.
The high speed broadband connectivity will be provided to government offices, educational institutions, hospitals, banks and other public service institutions.
Going along with the Centre’s BharatNet programme, the Telangana government showcased its ambitious Fiber Grid (T-Fiber) program at the World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT) 2018 in Hyderabad on 19th Feburary 2018.
It established a Technology Demonstration Network (TDN), which is the pilot of the program, covering nearly 50 government offices and households in four villages of Ranga Reddy district and showcased the services being offered. The first showcase of the government’s ambitious project, Union Minister for Electronics & IT Ravi Shankar Prasad, inaugurated the TDN on the sidelines of the summit.

"T-Fiber is envisioned to establish a state of the art network  infrastructure to facilitate the realization of ‘Digital Telangana’"
At the World Congress IT 2018, the pilot T-FIBER Technology Demonstration Network (TDN) under the umbrella of Digital Telangana has been launched by Hon.  Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad for Communications & IT and Hon. Minister K T Rama Rao for IT, Electronics & Communication.
TDN connects around 55 locations in the four villages of the Maheshwaram Mandal to Hyderabad locations.  The villages under Maheshwaram Mandal are Mansapally, Thummaloor, Sirigiripuram and Maheshwaram Mandal Village are connected to Pragati Bhawan, Raj Bhawan, Secretariat, HICC and the T-Fiber Begumpet Office at Hyderabad.
The objective of the TDN is to demonstrate the capabilities of the T-Fiber once the entire network infrastructure is laid out in Telangana. TDN is built on the existing optic fiber cable of the NOFN phase 1.
A total of 215 Kms of additional aerial optic fiber cable has been installed by the participating connectivity partners – Sterlite, L&T and HFCL. The network is powered by the best in class technology by the partners like CISCO and Nokia.
Currently, the network is capable of delivering 1Gbps to homes and offices. Services demonstrated during the launch are ePanchyat, eAgriculture, TeleMedicine, eEducation, Video Conference, Government to Citizen Services such as MeeSeva,T-Wallet, IPTV and IP-Phone services.
The current services partners under the TDN include Cisco,Sterlite, HPE, MeeSeva, TSAT,  Corpus, D-Link, Quadgen, E-Abhyas, Micromax, Kisan Raja and Celkon.
TDN is witnessing overwhelming intent of participation from the industry players, hence, to welcome the industry to use the TDN as the test bed for developing next generation services, the network shall be made available for at least one year. The services and technologies developed over the TDN can be promptly adopted in the flagship project of T-Fiber which will be a significant mile under the Digital Telanagana and ultimately fulfilling the Digital India initiative. This immense potential of TDN will benefit and empower the people of Telangana.

"T-Fiber is envisioned to establish a state of the art network  infrastructure to facilitate the realization of ‘Digital Telangana’"
Mission Bhagiratha, the prestigious project being undertaken by the Rural Water Supply & Sanitation (RWS&S) department, Govt. of Telangana aims at providing clean drinking water to every household in the state of Telangana. For this purpose, Mission Bhagiratha is undertaking trenching and digging activity across the state for laying water pipelines. T-Fiber is utilizing this opportunity to minimize its project cost by carrying out the underground duct and fiber laying along with the laying of water grid in Telangana. In other words, T-Fiber will piggy back on the Mission Bhagiratha Project, which provides safe drinking water to every household through water pipelines, thereby achieving Right of Way (RoW) and saving on digging & trenching cost for laying of optical fiber cable across the whole state. The network will be deployed along water supply routes which have been already mapped for the entire state. By leveraging the trenches for RWS&S the state intends to combine the utilization of same trench for two utilities, i.e. Drinking Water & High Speed Broadband up to every household in rural Telangana, thereby saving on duplication of work and saving on enormous additional trenching cost. In addition to this, RWS&S has already obtained all the necessary permissions including ROW for laying of water pipe lines across the State of Telangana. Therefore, no additional permissions or cost for acquiring ROW would be incurred for laying of OFC.

G2G Services
T-Fiber will provide various services to the government departments. The following are some of the services that will be provided by T-Fiber.
Following are some of the departments that are to be served by T-fiber:
G2C Services
•	e-Education services: The literacy rate in Telangana is 67% which is much below the national average of 74.04% with rural areas further lagging behind. This is primarily because lack of easy access, teacher, infrastructure and common curricula as well as poverty and gender differentiation. These problems can be addressed through e-Education initiatives.
•	e-Health services: Telemedicine can bridge the distance and can make specialty care more accessible to rural and urban Populations. It can be a valuable tool in providing post discharge care to the patients who cannot ambulate and for the patients who stay abroad. It can be an excellent platform for isolated or rural health practitioners for continuing education or training and improving their skills. It can help avoid most of the costs borne by the patients in travel, diagnosis, delay in treatment and other emergency conditions.
•	e-Agriculture services: The latest development in the field of agriculture is e-Agriculture which can play a vital role in uplifting the agricultural community by providing technology and information enablers that enhance farm productivity and lead to increased income levels of farmers. ICT mechanisms can serve as a cost-effective mechanism for providing information at the click of a button for farmers.
•	e-Banking services: In recent years, the rural Population of India has also seen an increase in banking penetration but there still remains a need for further improvement. The banks face operational challenges in rural setup such as issues of cash management, security aspects, low volumes of transactions etc. which makes viability of rural banking a difficult undertaking.

"T-Fiber is envisioned to establish a state of the art network  infrastructure to facilitate the realization of ‘Digital Telangana’"
Government of Telangana has envisioned to establish a state-of-the-art network infrastructure to serve as backbone for Digital Telangana. The State aims to usher in digital democracy through affordable & reliable high-speed broadband connectivity to every household, government and private institution in Telangana. Telangana Fiber Grid project will provide infrastructure for affordable and high speed broadband connectivity and Digital services to 10 Zones (31 Districts),  584 Mandals, 8778 Gram Panchayats (~24,000 Habitations), 83.58 Lakh households and more than 2 Crore people. T-Fiber is based on the idea of providing access of infrastructure to different players on a non-discriminatory and non-monopolistic basis where the government will not become a service provider to deliver internet services to households and enterprises while different players shall be allowed to provide internet services to households and private enterprises. The network shall be capable of delivering 4-100 Mbps to household and on-demand 20-100 Mbps to institutions and enterprises. It is planned to have a 100G MPLS ring connecting Zones, a 40G MPLS ring is planned at Mandal (Block) level and 10G MPLS ring at GP level. Every household shall be further connected to the network over GPON that would involve extending of Optical Fiber Cable up to every household and installation of CPE for each house for delivery of G2G, G2C & telecom services. Telangana Fiber Grid project will also utilize synergy with the prestigious Mission Bhagiratha by laying the OFC along Mission Bhagiratha routes wherever possible to avoid digging & trenching costs.
