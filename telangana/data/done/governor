History of Raj Bhavan, Hyderabad
RAJ BHAVAN, Hyderabad, the Official residence of the Governor of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, 
is spread over an area of about 21.50 Acres (8.4 hectares).  Sometime during the 
1930s, the Nizam's Government acquired an earlier estate of Nawab Shahzore Jung 
and Sayyad Akil Bilgrami for the then Prime Minister's official residence. As seen 
from Hyderabad city's old maps of 1914, the estate of Nawab Shahzore Jung consisted  
of two older buildings at the place where the present Durbar Hall is located. These 
were pulled down to make room for the subsequent new structures.
The present Durbar Hall was built around 1936 and has a relative simple facade consisting 
of a single large Islamic arch approached by a modest flight of stairs, deep overhanging 
Chajjas and cement Jallies covering other openings. Most probably designed by architects 
Eric Marrett and Zain Yar Jung, the Durbar Hall resembles other contemporary buildings, 
namely the Jubilee Hall and Bal Bhavan in the Public Gardens and the Lady Hydari Club in 
Basheer Bagh locality, designed by the same architects.
The earliest occupant of the Durbar Hall building was Sir Akbar Hydari, the Prime Minister 
of the Nizam from 1936 to 1941. But he stayed here for a short period and shifted his residence 
to an adjacent building which is now the Dilkusha Guest House. Subsequent Prime Ministers to 
stay here were the Nawab of Chattari (1941-1946 and again during May-November, 1947), Sir Mirza 
Ismail (August, 1946 to May, 1947), Sir Mehdi Yar Jung (November-December, 1947) and Mir Laik 
Ali, President of the Council of Interim Government (1947-48).
Shah Manzil, one of the pre-1914 buildings, is an architectural landmark. 
It has a striking similarity with the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly building at 
Public Gardens because of its late Mughal arches, projecting windows and Chhatris 
(lanterns) over parapets in typical Rajasthani style. The office of the Advisors to 
Governor of Telangana is presently located in Shah Manzil.
The Raj Bhavan, Hyderabad is among the most important notified heritage 
Buildings of Hyderabad city.
