Speed Governor

Speed Governor :
What is a Speed Governor
How many types of speed governor's are available
Is it true that the speed governors damage the engine and reduce the pick up.
What are the speeds notified by the Government of Andhra Pradesh
How do I select a speed governor?
Top ^
A speed governor is a speed limiting device which either acts on the fuel supply line or the accelerator to control the speed at a specified speed.
There are primarily two types of speed governors ( speed limiter device).
Fuel Control Type of SLD: The fuel control type of speed limiter device reduces the fuel momentarily when the driving speed exceeds the specified speed.
Accelerator Control SLD: The accelerator control speed limiter device operates on the accelerator of the vehicle, which will be disabled beyond the specified speed.
either of the type of speed limiter device do not impact on the engine or the pick up
This is a general misconception as the speed governors merely operate to control the speed of a vehicle to the set speed of the governor.  they either work on the fuel line or on the accelerator.  Either of the speed governors never impact the engine or the pick up.   The pick up of a vehicle would depend on a variety of factors which include horse power of the vehicle, contracted load, torque of the engine, condition of the vehicle and the engine, no. of kilometers run, condition of the roads etc.
Government of Andhra Pradesh have notified the fitment of speed governors on all transport vehicles vide G.O.Ms. No .... Dated. 14.7. 2009 The same has been published int he gazette on the 16th of July, 2009.  Vide the said notification the following are the speeds notified:
Before purchasing a speed governor you must check if the speed governor being purchased has a valid approval from the testing agency as prescribed by the government of India.  the certificate of approval should be specific and be applicable for
Make of the Vehicle
Class of the Vehicle
Speed as notified by the Government namely 50 KMPH or 65 KMPH.
As a matter of caution please check if the vendor selling the speed governors has got a good service back up.

The department maintains a central database and provides services to the police and other departments upon request.
Each office is equipped with an efficient help desk to answer all the queries of customers and the relevant forms. Most offices are equipped with the token system where disposals at the counters are done in an efficient manner. To make services reliable and less time consuming, the department has introduced the system of despatch of all statutory documents by speed post. Waiting the whole day at the transport office is now a thing of the past!

Contract carriage and Staged Carriage compared and contrasted-
(i) There must be a prior contract, express or implied (to transport a passenger or passengers)
A stage carriage is intended to meet different requirements of the general travelling public. But the contract carriages are for those who want to hire the vehicles collectively or individually for a group or party for their transport from place to place and the whole vehicle is at their disposal.
Most of the Stage Carriage Permits are exclusively held by APSRTC in all the Important Routes.

You cannot make any changes to the registration details of the vehicles after payment of life tax.  Any changes are possible only before payment of life tax.  Be careful to check with the customer before paying life tax.
Once the life tax is paid, the transaction is complete.  Any changes will only have to be made by way of vehicle sale/transfer.  No changes can be made one the life tax is paid.  henceforth, dealers are advised to book the vehicle only after confirming the sale of the vehicle from the customer.  Please take a signature of the customer on the draft copy for reccord so that the customer does not retract.
No changes will be permitted after the payment of the life tax.  Dealers are advised to check and recheck from the customer before payment of the life tax.  The payment of life tax on a vehicle freezes the transaction record of the customer.

What is a Speed Governor
How many types of speed governor's are available
Is it true that the speed governors damage the engine and reduce the pick up.
What are the speeds notified by the Government of Andhra Pradesh
How do I select a speed governor?
Top ^
A speed governor is a speed limiting device which either acts on the fuel supply line or the accelerator to control the speed at a specified speed.
There are primarily two types of speed governors ( speed limiter device).
Fuel Control Type of SLD: The fuel control type of speed limiter device reduces the fuel momentarily when the driving speed exceeds the specified speed.
Accelerator Control SLD: The accelerator control speed limiter device operates on the accelerator of the vehicle, which will be disabled beyond the specified speed.
either of the type of speed limiter device do not impact on the engine or the pick up
This is a general misconception as the speed governors merely operate to control the speed of a vehicle to the set speed of the governor.  they either work on the fuel line or on the accelerator.  Either of the speed governors never impact the engine or the pick up.   The pick up of a vehicle would depend on a variety of factors which include horse power of the vehicle, contracted load, torque of the engine, condition of the vehicle and the engine, no. of kilometers run, condition of the roads etc.
Government of Andhra Pradesh have notified the fitment of speed governors on all transport vehicles vide G.O.Ms. No .... Dated. 14.7. 2009 The same has been published int he gazette on the 16th of July, 2009.  Vide the said notification the following are the speeds notified:
Before purchasing a speed governor you must check if the speed governor being purchased has a valid approval from the testing agency as prescribed by the government of India.  the certificate of approval should be specific and be applicable for
Make of the Vehicle
Class of the Vehicle
Speed as notified by the Government namely 50 KMPH or 65 KMPH.
As a matter of caution please check if the vendor selling the speed governors has got a good service back up.

Contract Carriage
(a) On a time basis, whether or not with reference to any route or distance; or
(b) From one point to another,
And in either case, without stopping to pick up or set down passengers not included in the contract any where during the journey.
Contract carriage and Staged Carriage compared and contrasted-
(i) There must be a prior contract, express or implied (to transport a passenger or passengers)
A stage carriage is intended to meet different requirements of the general travelling public. But the contract carriages are for those who want to hire the vehicles collectively or individually for a group or party for their transport from place to place and the whole vehicle is at their disposal.
Most of the Stage Carriage Permits are exclusively held by APSRTC in all the Important Routes.

Driving Licence
The Government of TELANGANA is committed to provide Simple, Moral, Accountable, Responsive and Transparent (SMART) services to the people through the concept of Citizens' Charter. The Transport Department, as part of the implementation of this Citizens' Charter, has simplified the procedures to get a Driving Licence.
SPECIAL PROGRAM
For obtaining a Driving Licence, one can approach the offices of Transport Department on all working days. Apart from this, the Government has initiated a special program for the convenience of the public. Accordingly, the Transport Department has made special arrangements on Monday and Tuesday of every week and also on every fourth Saturday of the month from 9 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. to issue Driving Licences.

Our Commitment
The Transport Department stands fully committed to fully computerized citizen friendly services. This has been made possible by an extensive network of computers linking all the RTO and Unit Offices spread across the state. The department stands fully committed to the Citizens Charter and strives to achieve the deadlines for services set by the charter. We continue to ensure that the department is constantly refined in the administration of its processes and procedures to reduce time delays and achieve the stated mission of being a responsive and transparent department.
Some of the initiatives that have effected sweeping changes are the any service any counter, adherence of the operations to the citizens charter schedules; simplification of the procedures; enabling online slot booking for scheduling a driving test; a user friendly website with all the information needed for any novice including all the web-fill able forms; computerised test for learner's licence and online booking for services in advance are some of the initiatives that have made the department not only responsive but also provide services in a transparent manner. The department maintains a central database and provides services to the police and other departments upon request.
Each office is equipped with an efficient help desk to answer all the queries of customers and the relevant forms. Most offices are equipped with the token system where disposals at the counters are done in an efficient manner. To make services reliable and less time consuming, the department has introduced the system of despatch of all statutory documents by speed post. Waiting the whole day at the transport office is now a thing of the past!

Speed Governor :
What is a Speed Governor
How many types of speed governor's are available
Is it true that the speed governors damage the engine and reduce the pick up.
What are the speeds notified by the Government of Andhra Pradesh
How do I select a speed governor?
Top ^
A speed governor is a speed limiting device which either acts on the fuel supply line or the accelerator to control the speed at a specified speed.
There are primarily two types of speed governors ( speed limiter device).
Fuel Control Type of SLD: The fuel control type of speed limiter device reduces the fuel momentarily when the driving speed exceeds the specified speed.
Accelerator Control SLD: The accelerator control speed limiter device operates on the accelerator of the vehicle, which will be disabled beyond the specified speed.
either of the type of speed limiter device do not impact on the engine or the pick up
This is a general misconception as the speed governors merely operate to control the speed of a vehicle to the set speed of the governor.  they either work on the fuel line or on the accelerator.  Either of the speed governors never impact the engine or the pick up.   The pick up of a vehicle would depend on a variety of factors which include horse power of the vehicle, contracted load, torque of the engine, condition of the vehicle and the engine, no. of kilometers run, condition of the roads etc.
Government of Andhra Pradesh have notified the fitment of speed governors on all transport vehicles vide G.O.Ms. No .... Dated. 14.7. 2009 The same has been published int he gazette on the 16th of July, 2009.  Vide the said notification the following are the speeds notified:
Before purchasing a speed governor you must check if the speed governor being purchased has a valid approval from the testing agency as prescribed by the government of India.  the certificate of approval should be specific and be applicable for
Make of the Vehicle
Class of the Vehicle
Speed as notified by the Government namely 50 KMPH or 65 KMPH.
As a matter of caution please check if the vendor selling the speed governors has got a good service back up.

Once the life tax is paid, the transaction is complete.  Any changes will only have to be made by way of vehicle sale/transfer.  No changes can be made one the life tax is paid.  henceforth, dealers are advised to book the vehicle only after confirming the sale of the vehicle from the customer.  Please take a signature of the customer on the draft copy for reccord so that the customer does not retract.
No changes will be permitted after the payment of the life tax.  Dealers are advised to check and recheck from the customer before payment of the life tax.  The payment of life tax on a vehicle freezes the transaction record of the customer.
