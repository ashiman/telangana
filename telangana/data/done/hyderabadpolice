Common Frauds
MOST COMMON FRAUDS
Fraud is becoming an increasingly common problem. So what are the most common types of fraud?
Fake emails
Email fraud is the intentional deception made for personal gain or to damage another individual through email. Almost as soon as email became widely used, it began to be used as a means to defraud people. Email fraud can take the form of a "con game" or scam. Confidence tricks tend to exploit the inherent greed and dishonesty of their victims. The prospect of a 'bargain' or 'something for nothing' can be very tempting. Email fraud, as with other 'bunco schemes' usually targets naive individuals who put their confidence in get-rich-quick schemes such as 'too good to be true' investments or offers to sell popular items at 'impossibly low' prices. Many people have lost their life savings due to fraud
419 Frauds
419 frauds - most regular scams committed. Scammers send emails and letters to victims asking for a certain amount of money in order to secure a larger sum.
                        The Nigerian 419 scam is a common example of this - the "419" refers to the Nigerian Criminal Code that deals with fraud.
Please note that the list of 419 (Nigerian Advanced Fee Fraud) scam types described below does not include all possible variants. Do not assume that if it is not on this list that the email sent to you is legitimate. For additional information on how to identify these scams, please see the Top 10 Warning Signs page. Be scam aware. Be educated.
ATM Card 419 Scam:
Auction 419 Scam:
Black Currency 419 Scam:
Cashier's Cheque 419 Scam:

Tips to Avoid 419 Advance Fee Fraud
The best tip is to DELETE any mail from a stranger which resembles the mails we described above.
Same mail may be forwarded to the service provider's mail ID like abuse[dot]yahoo.com, abuse[dot]hotmail.com depending on the senders mail ID.
Similarly you can forward the mail before you junk it to local police email ID if they have any
Credit & Debit card fraud
Credit card fraud is a wide-ranging term for theft and fraud committed using a credit card or any similar payment mechanism as a fraudulent source of payment in a transaction. The purpose may be to obtain goods without paying, or to obtain unauthorized funds from an account. Credit card fraud is also an add-on to identity theft.
                          Card account information is stored in a number of formats. Account numbers are often embossed or imprinted on the card, and a magnetic stripe on the back contains the data in machine readable format.
Debit card fraud - duplicating one or more of your bank cards, makes up the most regularly seen types of fraud.
What types of Credit Card Fraud are there?
Mail/Internet order fraud:
Account takeover:
There are two types of fraud within the identity theft category, application fraud and account takeover.
Application fraud occurs when criminals use stolen or fake documents to open an account in someone else's name. Criminals may try to steal documents such as utility bills and bank statements to build up useful personal information. Alternatively, they may create counterfeit documents.
Some merchants added a new practice to protect consumers and self reputation, where they ask the buyer to send a copy of the physical card and statement to ensure the legitimate usage of a card.
Skimming:
Skimming is the theft of credit card information used in an otherwise legitimate transaction. It is typically an "inside job" by a dishonest employee of a legitimate merchant, and can be as simple as photocopying of receipts. Common scenarios for skimming are restaurants or bars where the skimmer has possession of the victim's credit card out of their immediate view. The skimmer will typically use a small keypad to unobtrusively transcribe the 3 or 4 digit Card Security Code which is not present on the magnetic strip.
Instances of skimming have been reported where the perpetrator has put a device over the card slot of a public cash machine (automated teller machine), which reads the magnetic strip as the user unknowingly passes their card through it. These devices are often used in conjunction with a pinhole camera to read the user's PIN at the same time.
Carding:
Safety tips to avoid Credit Card Fraud
1. There is a critical 3-digit number on the back of the card called CVV (card verification value). Always erase and memorise it.
Safety tips to avoid Debit or ATM Card fraud
1. When you type your PIN number at an ATM, make sure that you sufficiently obscure the keypad from being viewed by an onlooker.
Using ATM machine
1. Safeguard your credit cards and ATM cards at all times.
Job Fraud
We often see that several unemployed youth paying huge cash to fraudsters for securing jobs in Government Services or Corporate Sector.
Taking advantage of the innocence of these unemployed youth, fraudsters float fictitious companies and give attractive advertisements to the press and attract the unemployed youth towards them and after collecting money as 'caution deposit/security deposit' and dupe them. Here are some of the frauds committed by such criminals.
Fake JOB VISA for employment abroad
Training and employment in the same company and Employment abroad
Data warehousing works.
Employment fraud in Railways Recruitment
EEmployment in reputed PSU s and Private Companies.
Group II/I of TSPSC fraud
How to Suspect a Fraud?
If you find any of the following signs in your transactions, you have strong reason to SUSPECT it...
Transactions being carried in cash
Originals are missing and certified copies are shown to you.
Documents in colour Xerox and laminated
Signatures are varied in all places
Documents are only notarized

Women Safety
SAFETY TIPS FOR WOMEN
Have you ever felt frightened or intimidated when out walking alone? Have you ever wondered what you should do if approached by an attacker? Have you ever worried about becoming yet another home invasion statistic?
The sad reality is that we live in an increasingly violent society in which the fear of crime is ever-present. Personal safety has become an issue of importance for everyone, but especially for women.
EVERY WOMAN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT PERSONAL SAFETY
1. Awareness: Your first line of defence. Most people think of kicks to the groin and blocking punches when they hear the term "self-defence." However, true self-defence begins long before any actual physical contact. The first, and probably most important, component in self-defence is awareness: awareness of yourself, your surroundings, and your potential attacker's likely strategies.

The criminal's primary strategy is to use the advantage of surprise. Studies have shown that criminals are adept at choosing targets who appear to be unaware of what is going on around them. By being aware of your surroundings and by projecting a "force presence," many altercations which are commonplace on the street can be avoided.
a) Avoid martial arts studios unless you specifically wish to train in the traditional martial arts techniques and are prepared for a long-term commitment. Many women's self-defence programs teach watered-down martial arts techniques that are complex and unrealistic under the stress of an actual attack;
b) The self-defence program should include simulated assaults, with a fully padded instructor in realistic rape and attack scenarios, to allow you to practice what you've learned.
4. Escape: Always your best option. What if the unthinkable happens? You are suddenly confronted by a predator who demands that you go with him-be it in a car, or into an alley, or a building. It would seem prudent to obey, but you must never leave the primary crime scene. You are far more likely to be killed or seriously injured if you go with the predator than if you run away (even if he promises not to hurt you). Run away, yell for help, throw a rock on a store or car window-do whatever you can to attract attention. And if the criminal is after your purse or other material items, throw them one way while you run the other.
EVE-TEASING
Streets, bus stands, railway stations, parks and other public places should be for everyone to access and enjoy. Yet for many women they are the scenes of harassment. Everyday women face systematic assault on their fundamental right to free movement and personal dignity.
SEXUAL HARRSEMENT
Sexual Harassment affects all women in some form or the other. Lewd remarks, touching, wolf-whistles, "looks" are part of any woman's life, so much so that it is dismissed as normal.
                         Working women are no exception. In fact, working women most commonly face the backlash, to women taking new roles, which belong to male domains especially in the organized sector. In the unorganized sector also it is widely prevalent. Studies have shown that sexual harassment is still endemic, often hidden, and present in all kinds of organisations. 40-60% working women face harassment at working places.
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
Within the four walls of homes, the violence against women is quite high. Domestic violence against is widely prevalent, but has remained largely invisible. Statistics reveal that 45% of Indian women are slapped, kicked or beaten by their husbands. (ICRW 2002) .32% had committed acts of violence against their pregnant wives. Every 60 minutes a woman dies in India due to domestic violence. Women accept violence because social norms sanction them. At the same time, cultural conditioning and economic dependence prevent the vast majority of women leaving their marital homes. Though there is criminal law to prevent domestic violence, the recent civil law Protection of women from Domestic Violence is aimed at providing relief, compensation and support to a woman.
DOWRY HARRASEMENT
1. In India, Dowry system that has been prevailing amongst every society and affected lives of the people who are involved in marriage and on those who are around.

Types of Crimes
Classification of Crimes
There are a variety of crimes that can be committed by individuals. Some crimes, such as murder or kidnapping, are considered serious crimes by society. Other crimes, such as speeding or trespassing, are not considered serious. Although all crimes mean a violation of the law, there's a wide range of punishments that can be imposed on a criminal.
The classification of a crime is based on the extent of punishment that can be given for committing it. The punishment is usually based on the seriousness of the crime. States may differ as to the classification of any particular crime. A crime committed in one state may be classified differently than if it was committed in another state.
Crimes against the Person
A crime against the person is a crime that's committed using direct harm or force against the victim. Usually the most serious crimes, such as murder or rape, are crimes against the person. These crimes are many times felonies because of the seriousness of harming another person. However, some lower level crimes, such as harassment or assault without a weapon, may be considered misdemeanors
Crimes against Property
A crime against property is a crime that's committed by damaging or intruding on the property of the victim. Burglary and arson are two crimes against property that are normally felonies. Criminal mischief, which involves the intentional destruction of property, goes from a misdemeanor to a felony based on the value of the damage. Criminal trespass is usually classified as a misdemeanor
Felony Crimes
A felony is considered a serious crime. Most states and the federal government classify a crime that's punishable by more than one year in prison as a felony. Some states consider a felony as any crime that's punishable by any length of time in prison. A felony that's punishable by death is considered a capital crime.
There are many different crimes that are considered felonies in most states. Some common felonies include:
Murder, Rape, Burglary, Kidnapping, Arson and Robbery
Misdemeanor Crimes
A misdemeanor is considered a less serious crime. Most states and the federal government classify a crime that's punishable by less than one year in prison as a misdemeanor. Some states consider a misdemeanor as any crime that's punishable only by fine or a small length of time in jail. If a misdemeanor is considered a very minor offense, such as jaywalking, the crime may be classified as a petty offense.
There's a wide variety of crimes that are considered misdemeanors in most states. Some common misdemeanors include:
Public intoxication, Trespassing, Vandalism, Speeding and Use of a false ID
Theft and Fraud Crimes
There are a wide variety of theft and fraud crimes that involve illegally taking a victim's property. Whether a theft or a fraud crime is a misdemeanor or a felony usually depends on the value of the property stolen and the method used to commit the crime. A fraud crime is a crime in which deception is used to cause another person to suffer financial harm. Robbery, which is the taking of property from another using force, is classified as a felony.
Crimes against Public Order
A crime against public order is a crime that harms the community. Some examples include disorderly conduct, public lewdness, and prostitution. Many crimes against public order are considered misdemeanors. However, if a minor child is a victim, the misdemeanor may be raised to a felony
Drug-Related Crimes
Crimes relating to drugs involve manufacture, possession, distribution and sale. Possessing a small amount of illegal drugs will usually be classified as a misdemeanor. However, distributing and selling large amounts of illegal drugs will almost always be classified as a felony.

NENU SAITHAM-CCTV PROJECT
NENU SAITHAM (నేను సైతం)
The Government of Telangana has initiated a series of measures to upgrade the standards of safety and security in the Capital City of Hyderabad with an objective to transform Hyderabad City into a Global City and Hyderabad City Police into a Global City Police.
One of the most popular and cost-effective ways of providing comprehensive security is Electronic Video Surveillance (CCTV) System. It acts as a very successful deterrent to reduce/eliminate crime and it is vital to provide adequate protection to the citizens. As part of this effort, the Police Department has already initiated various citizen’s safety and security programs such as City-wide Safe City Project, Community CCTV Project and Nenusaitham Project.  The advent of City-wide Community CCTV implementation has already experienced the greatest impact on crime by the police in downward trend of crime patterns by an average of 16% year-on-year.
Click here to Download..
Nenusaitham Project’s
The system helps the individuals, residential and business communities in::
Prevention of Crime
Prevention of Thefts
Act of Evidence
Monitor high risk areas
Solve Crime through video footage by Police
encourage good behavior, and
Increase Citizen’s Confidence.
The supplier collaboration can often make the long-term sustainability and deliver the tangible benefits to the society through this initiative as a critical success factor.  It is important to critically understand the suppliers profile to build strong relationships with the citizens in safeguarding their investments and keeping the system operational for a longer period.
Therefore, it is essential to affect the selection of qualified suppliers through a criterion of each having
Goods & Service Tax (GST) registered with concerned tax agencies, and
Minimum two years of experience in implementation of IP based CCTV system.
The responsibilities of supplier are to supply, install, commission and deploy the IP based CCTV systems including support and maintenance of the system through its intended warranty period.

The prime motive of "Safe Colony at night" is to prevent crime 
                           by educating and motivating the particular Society / Colony. The local Police shall identify crime prone colonies where House breakings, burglaries, snatchings, eve teasing, un-social elements and other kind of crime occur regularly
Study will be made about the Topography of the safe colony depicting mosques, darghas, temples, schools, colleges, banks, Crime spots and other important places
The Safe Colony Management Committees will 
                            appoint Safe colony protection Squad (S.C.P.S) and  ID Cards will be issued involving youth of the colony for guarding and watching the colony during nights. This S.C.P.S with the coordination of sector SIsfPatrol car/Blue colt staff will close all the entry/exist points of the colony by placing barricades between l0 P.M and 6 A.M every day and will keep open only one or two entry and one or two exit point and they will man at the points with registers. lt will help in checking the movement of criminals and at the same time prevent outsiders from entering the colony during night and creating nuisance. The Police will also assist the local colony welfare associations in choosing the routes that are to be kept open in the night.
Limited entry/exit during night (10.00 PM - 5.00 AM).
Mobile barricades with signages to be erected.
The Local Police shall identify strategic junctions, entry/exit points to the colonies and get the CCTV Cameras erected alongwith a backbone network connected to a local Command Centre situated at a convenient place within the colony, to be monitored by a representative of colony on 24 X 7 basis.
Security Guards at entry & exit points
Night Patrols by Community Volunteers
Taking security aspects into consideration, Sector sub-Inspector, patrol car, blue colts staff shall liaise with colony association /SCPS /volunteers /security guards to prevent offences
Sector Sls, Patrol ear, Blue colt staff to have one to one and one to many (Group Contact - Bulk SMS) for exchange of information regarding prevention of crime
Association committee should properly intimate to the Police Station about locked houses in their colony for keeping proper vigil on such houses by Police at the time of their patrolling
Colony should have "Safe Colony Management Committees" for easy redress of complaint, if any. For this purpose during the awareness sessions proactive citizens from the locality must be identified and encouraged.
Identification cards to Community Volunteers to be issued by Colony Association.
The Role of Police is minimal and the colony welfare associations will take the responsibility of security & monitoring of CCTVs which shall be installed at the entry and exit points of the safe colony and also ensure proper lighting in the colony with the help of GHMC
The Police will hold meetings with the Colony Resident Welfare Associations and ensure that the established system is properly kept up and run
The voluntary participation of the colony people is essential for effective implementation of this concept.
The list of the inhabitants shall be collected from the colony Association..
Local Police shall co-ordinate with various departments like GHMC, Electricity, Fire, in case of need.
Shall collect the contact numbers of the agencies like Security Guards, Newspaper agencies/boys, cable operators, Milk suppliers, domestic servants, electricians, plumbers etc from the colony welfare associations
Display of photographs of repeated property offenders
All the colony people should know help lines phone number of Police as well as local Police for quick alertness. Alarming system should be installed in the locality.
Make Sector Sl responsible for coordination with the concerned colony communities for smooth functioning of the project.
ACP and SHO to involve overseeing the implementation of the project and periodic Community meetings to be held for feedback and improve the functioning.
Planning of parking areas within the Colony
Planning of clean and green colony - location of garbage dumps, plantations
Planning the locations of Bus Stops and other Community inter-face facilities
Action against stray cattle, stray dogs.
Putting up of Suggestion Boxes
The success of these initiatives lies in the citizens pro active participation at every stage. This is possible only with the Police Station role as a facilitator from the initial stage itself.

HISTORY OF HYDERABAD CITY POLICE
POLICE SYSTEM DURING NIZAM PERIOD
The erstwhile State of Nizam comprised areas covered of the present Telangana of AP State, Bidar, Raichur and Gulburga, districts of present Karnataka State and Osmanabad. Bheed, Nanded, Latur, Aurangabad and Parbhani districts of the present Maharashtra State. Hyderabad was the Capital of Nizam. As per the available records, the Police Commissionerate system existed way back from the year 1847. The Nizam of Hyderabad used to appoint the Commissioners of Police who were officers of the Hyderabad Civil Service and they used to function during his pleasure. They were answerable to the Nizam directly on various matters of policing in Hyderabad city. However as far as administrative matters were concerned the Commissioner of Police used to correspond with the Home Department directly. The commissioner of Police was popularly called as "KOTWAL" and was responsible for maintenance of law and order, prevention of detection of crime etc. The correspondence used to be only in Urdu. Kotwal enjoying a high position and look upon with great respect of fear had always been appointed from an early period and he had under him a public force composed of various nationalities and a number of detectives.
The "Kotwal" combined in his office not only the powers and privileges of the police head, but also was in enjoyment of certain judicial and civil powers. He had direct access to the king and had his ears. He was the chief adviser to the monarch in all police matters. He was primarily responsible for the maintenance of law and order, for the prevention and control of crime, and prosecution of criminals. He occupied a unique position not only in the administration of criminal justice but also a very honourable place in the king's "Durbars". He received the "Roznamachas" (Daily reports) from the Thanedars about the happening in the city, kept a watch on the British Residency and maintained a number of paid informers. The "Kotwal-e-Balda" was both respected and feared by the general Public. The last of such powerful "Kotwals" was Raja Bahadur Venkatrama Reddy during the reign of Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan, Nizam-VII. He even resolved major litigations between Gadwal and Wanaparthi "samasthans"    through negotiatios. In the big "Samasthans", policing was being done by the big feudal lords, who owned vast chunks of land, and organized their respective police forces and a separate judicial service.
The Head of the "Thana" (Police Station) came to be called "Amin" The rank equivalent to inspector was known as "Sardar Amin". The Assistant Commissioner of Police and the Deputy Commissioner were called "Madadgar Kotwal" and "Naib Kotwal" respectively. The entire city police force had distinctive uniforms and badges of rank. At the "Thana" level there was a "Jemadar" (General Duty Head Constable) and a Mohriri (Writer Head Constable). The Constabulary was called Barkandaz in the beginning and later called "Jawan". He was getting Rs. 6-00 in 1902 A.D. as pay and two annas per day was his daily allowance, whenever he had to travel outside Hyderabad City.
The Judicial system prevailing in the city comprised of the Diwani Adalatas (Civil Courts) and Faujdari Adalats i.e Criminal Courts, Organised in a hierarchical pettem, having both the original and appellate jurisdiction. The lowest combined criminal and civil courts under the Munsif Magistrate with 1st Class powers of trial at the original level at all taluk head quarters.
The prosecuting agency consisted of Police functionaries of inspectors rank and so far as the city was concerned. They were under Naib Kotwal Seghal Jaraim i.e. Dy. Commissioner of Police Crime. The strength of city police in the early years of this century was hardly a few thousands, quite commensurate with the limited needs of the populations of Hyderabad, which was barely 2.5 lakhs, enclosed within an impregnable fort-wall running round the city. There were thirteen huge gates and as many windows which used to be closed by the Police Armed guards from dust to dawn, by an order of the city Police Commissioner. This system ensures automatic "Nakabandi" and no burglar or thief having operated in the city could dare leave the precincts of the city without being caught and interrogated. The city police budget in 1906 was a meager few lakhs. Except for Police Station "Thana and outpost "Naka" buildings, of which there was a network, there were few Administrative Police Buildings. The Present Commissioner office "Kotwal Balda" which is more than hundred years old is situated in "Purana Haveli" locality in the heart of the old city. There were no motor vehicles, wireless equipments and telephone facility. But there are many records maintained in Urdu at the P.S. level, a few obsolete fire arms and hand-cuffs and leg-lrons. The concept of respecting the rights of the individual was not at all there and criminals were dealt with harshly to say the least. Surveillance over criminals was effective and "Goondas" and rowdies were kept under check Mostly, religious processions and assemblies were in evidence those days and hardly labour or student troubles. Strikes by Government employees were unheard of and hardly any forms of protests by political parties were noticed
In 1271 Fasll, the total police under the control of the kotwal composed, as it was, of Arabs, Sikhs, Bharkandazes and Harkaras numbered 1524 foot men and 136 mounted and cost Rs. 82,364/- for its maintenance.
In 1294 Fasll, a Detective police force was inaugurated. The city police had three superior officers, 2 Muhatamims, 10 Sadar Amins, 27 Amins, 3 Naib Amins, 49 Sowars, 2830 Constables of all grades, 128 Arabs and 64 miscellaneous men. The strength of the city police rose to 3434 by the year 1337 Fasli. Cases of corruption were very rare. Among all the commissioner of Police who served during the Nizam period. Raja Bahadur Venkatram Reddy who worked for nearly 14 years created a history in the city for his outstanding police administration and he commanded a great respect among the public.
HISTORY OF THE OLD CP OFFICE BUILDING
The present building, where the Commissioner of Police, office is situated was donated by Sir Salarjung Prime Minister of Hyderabad.
RE - ORGANISATION OF HYDERABAD CITY IN 1955
A scheme for the re-organisation of the City Police on the lines of Madras City Police was sanctioned by the Government of Hyderabad with effect from 15-07-1955 in so far as it related to the bifurcation of the duties into Law and Order and Crime and the extension of the City Police jurisdiction to the Muncipal limits.

BE A CRIME BUSTER
DO AND DONT'S
You might be coming across a lot of activity what you consider as a crime in your locality.
As a dutiful Indian you can’t tolerate this anymore.
You decide to inform police but you do not know how and to whom.
Here we teach you how to become a Crime Buster Yourself
Information is vital for the success of any police operation against the criminals. We consider passing information to the police is one of the most sacred duties of a citizen.
At the same time, we regard the safety of the Crime Buster to be more than that of ours.
We give handsome rewards to the law abiding citizens who give us information about ongoing crime or any major racket if it turns out to be true.
What can you inform ?
About the persons who are amassing property disproportionate to their legal sources of income

Adulteration of foods, medicines, seeds, fertilizers and fuels, scams in weights and measures etc.
Major financial frauds like bank frauds, chit fund frauds, multilevel marketing or money circulation schemes, tax evasion etc
Stolen golden ornaments, vehicle, mobile, laptop rackets etc.
Job Offer frauds, visa frauds.
Terrorist activity like collection of explosives, doubtful tenants, suspicious persons etc
Counterfeit (fake) Currency
Any murder plots or extortion and kidnapping gangs

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.
Never boast about your relationship with the police publicly or privately and never promise others that you will get their work done through the police officer you know.
Never reveal your relationship with the police officer even to other policemen unless you are forced to.
Being informant is not an occupation; hence never introduce yourself as an Informant.
Never talk to policemen publicly about your information.
Never reveal your Code name and your actions even to your close relatives and friends.
If a police officer is reckless in handling, call off your relationship with him and complain to his superiors.
Never give false information to police to take revenge on those with whom you have differences.
Never try to cheat police when you meet them. Always remember, Police are trained to test information which they develop.
Never abuse your relationship with the police and indulge in crime yourself for a gain.
If you come across someone who has successfully informed aboutsome crime to the police in your friends circle or your locality,just ignore him. Do not unnecessarily talk about it. Be proud of him.
It s always exciting to get publicly acknowledged, but strictly avoid publicity to the brave act you have done.
Never show off with your reward. That might expose you.

As a dutiful Indian you can’t tolerate this anymore.
You decide to inform police but you do not know how and to whom.
Here we teach you how to become a Crime Buster Yourself
Information is vital for the success of any police operation against the criminals. We consider passing information to the police is one of the most sacred duties of a citizen.

Adulteration of foods, medicines, seeds, fertilizers and fuels, scams in weights and measures etc.
Major financial frauds like bank frauds, chit fund frauds, multilevel marketing or money circulation schemes, tax evasion etc

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.
Never boast about your relationship with the police publicly or privately and never promise others that you will get their work done through the police officer you know.
Never reveal your relationship with the police officer even to other policemen unless you are forced to.
Being informant is not an occupation; hence never introduce yourself as an Informant.
Never talk to policemen publicly about your information.
Never reveal your Code name and your actions even to your close relatives and friends.
If a police officer is reckless in handling, call off your relationship with him and complain to his superiors.
Never give false information to police to take revenge on those with whom you have differences.
Never try to cheat police when you meet them. Always remember, Police are trained to test information which they develop.
Never abuse your relationship with the police and indulge in crime yourself for a gain.
If you come across someone who has successfully informed aboutsome crime to the police in your friends circle or your locality,just ignore him. Do not unnecessarily talk about it. Be proud of him.
It s always exciting to get publicly acknowledged, but strictly avoid publicity to the brave act you have done.
Never show off with your reward. That might expose you.

BE A CRIME BUSTER
DO AND DONT'S
You might be coming across a lot of activity what you consider as a crime in your locality.
As a dutiful Indian you can’t tolerate this anymore.
You decide to inform police but you do not know how and to whom.
Here we teach you how to become a Crime Buster Yourself
Information is vital for the success of any police operation against the criminals. We consider passing information to the police is one of the most sacred duties of a citizen.
At the same time, we regard the safety of the Crime Buster to be more than that of ours.
We give handsome rewards to the law abiding citizens who give us information about ongoing crime or any major racket if it turns out to be true.
What can you inform ?
About the persons who are amassing property disproportionate to their legal sources of income
About organized crimes like fake documents, human trafficking, illegal organ transplantation rackets, sex rackets, drug peddling, explosives, possession or exhibition or use of deadly weapons like knives, daggers, hunting sickles and fire arms and credit cards scams, etc
Adulteration of foods, medicines, seeds, fertilizers and fuels, scams in weights and measures etc.
Major financial frauds like bank frauds, chit fund frauds, multilevel marketing or money circulation schemes, tax evasion etc
Stolen golden ornaments, vehicle, mobile, laptop rackets etc.
Job Offer frauds, visa frauds.
Terrorist activity like collection of explosives, doubtful tenants, suspicious persons etc
Counterfeit (fake) Currency
Any murder plots or extortion and kidnapping gangs
Illegal activities of Rowdy Sheeters viz., extortions, land grabbings, eve teasing, collection of Rowdy mamools and intimidating the people.
Information about illegal Immigrants like Bangladeshis, Pakistanis etc.

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.

BE A CRIME BUSTER
DO AND DONT'S
You might be coming across a lot of activity what you consider as a crime in your locality.
As a dutiful Indian you can’t tolerate this anymore.
You decide to inform police but you do not know how and to whom.
Here we teach you how to become a Crime Buster Yourself
Information is vital for the success of any police operation against the criminals. We consider passing information to the police is one of the most sacred duties of a citizen.
At the same time, we regard the safety of the Crime Buster to be more than that of ours.
We give handsome rewards to the law abiding citizens who give us information about ongoing crime or any major racket if it turns out to be true.
What can you inform ?
About the persons who are amassing property disproportionate to their legal sources of income
About organized crimes like fake documents, human trafficking, illegal organ transplantation rackets, sex rackets, drug peddling, explosives, possession or exhibition or use of deadly weapons like knives, daggers, hunting sickles and fire arms and credit cards scams, etc
Adulteration of foods, medicines, seeds, fertilizers and fuels, scams in weights and measures etc.
Major financial frauds like bank frauds, chit fund frauds, multilevel marketing or money circulation schemes, tax evasion etc
Stolen golden ornaments, vehicle, mobile, laptop rackets etc.
Job Offer frauds, visa frauds.
Terrorist activity like collection of explosives, doubtful tenants, suspicious persons etc
Counterfeit (fake) Currency
Any murder plots or extortion and kidnapping gangs
Illegal activities of Rowdy Sheeters viz., extortions, land grabbings, eve teasing, collection of Rowdy mamools and intimidating the people.
Information about illegal Immigrants like Bangladeshis, Pakistanis etc.

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.

As a dutiful Indian you can’t tolerate this anymore.
You decide to inform police but you do not know how and to whom.
Here we teach you how to become a Crime Buster Yourself
Information is vital for the success of any police operation against the criminals. We consider passing information to the police is one of the most sacred duties of a citizen.

We give handsome rewards to the law abiding citizens who give us information about ongoing crime or any major racket if it turns out to be true.
What can you inform ?
About the persons who are amassing property disproportionate to their legal sources of income

Adulteration of foods, medicines, seeds, fertilizers and fuels, scams in weights and measures etc.
Major financial frauds like bank frauds, chit fund frauds, multilevel marketing or money circulation schemes, tax evasion etc
Stolen golden ornaments, vehicle, mobile, laptop rackets etc.
Job Offer frauds, visa frauds.
Terrorist activity like collection of explosives, doubtful tenants, suspicious persons etc

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.
Never boast about your relationship with the police publicly or privately and never promise others that you will get their work done through the police officer you know.
Never reveal your relationship with the police officer even to other policemen unless you are forced to.
Being informant is not an occupation; hence never introduce yourself as an Informant.
Never talk to policemen publicly about your information.
Never reveal your Code name and your actions even to your close relatives and friends.
If a police officer is reckless in handling, call off your relationship with him and complain to his superiors.
Never give false information to police to take revenge on those with whom you have differences.
Never try to cheat police when you meet them. Always remember, Police are trained to test information which they develop.
Never abuse your relationship with the police and indulge in crime yourself for a gain.
If you come across someone who has successfully informed aboutsome crime to the police in your friends circle or your locality,just ignore him. Do not unnecessarily talk about it. Be proud of him.
It s always exciting to get publicly acknowledged, but strictly avoid publicity to the brave act you have done.
Never show off with your reward. That might expose you.

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.
Never boast about your relationship with the police publicly or privately and never promise others that you will get their work done through the police officer you know.
Never reveal your relationship with the police officer even to other policemen unless you are forced to.
Being informant is not an occupation; hence never introduce yourself as an Informant.
Never talk to policemen publicly about your information.
Never reveal your Code name and your actions even to your close relatives and friends.
If a police officer is reckless in handling, call off your relationship with him and complain to his superiors.
Never give false information to police to take revenge on those with whom you have differences.
Never try to cheat police when you meet them. Always remember, Police are trained to test information which they develop.
Never abuse your relationship with the police and indulge in crime yourself for a gain.
If you come across someone who has successfully informed aboutsome crime to the police in your friends circle or your locality,just ignore him. Do not unnecessarily talk about it. Be proud of him.
It s always exciting to get publicly acknowledged, but strictly avoid publicity to the brave act you have done.
Never show off with your reward. That might expose you.

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.
Never boast about your relationship with the police publicly or privately and never promise others that you will get their work done through the police officer you know.
Never reveal your relationship with the police officer even to other policemen unless you are forced to.
Being informant is not an occupation; hence never introduce yourself as an Informant.
Never talk to policemen publicly about your information.
Never reveal your Code name and your actions even to your close relatives and friends.
If a police officer is reckless in handling, call off your relationship with him and complain to his superiors.
Never give false information to police to take revenge on those with whom you have differences.
Never try to cheat police when you meet them. Always remember, Police are trained to test information which they develop.
Never abuse your relationship with the police and indulge in crime yourself for a gain.
If you come across someone who has successfully informed aboutsome crime to the police in your friends circle or your locality,just ignore him. Do not unnecessarily talk about it. Be proud of him.
It s always exciting to get publicly acknowledged, but strictly avoid publicity to the brave act you have done.
Never show off with your reward. That might expose you.

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.
Never boast about your relationship with the police publicly or privately and never promise others that you will get their work done through the police officer you know.
Never reveal your relationship with the police officer even to other policemen unless you are forced to.
Being informant is not an occupation; hence never introduce yourself as an Informant.
Never talk to policemen publicly about your information.
Never reveal your Code name and your actions even to your close relatives and friends.
If a police officer is reckless in handling, call off your relationship with him and complain to his superiors.
Never give false information to police to take revenge on those with whom you have differences.
Never try to cheat police when you meet them. Always remember, Police are trained to test information which they develop.
Never abuse your relationship with the police and indulge in crime yourself for a gain.
If you come across someone who has successfully informed aboutsome crime to the police in your friends circle or your locality,just ignore him. Do not unnecessarily talk about it. Be proud of him.
It s always exciting to get publicly acknowledged, but strictly avoid publicity to the brave act you have done.
Never show off with your reward. That might expose you.

As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's

Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.
Never boast about your relationship with the police publicly or privately and never promise others that you will get their work done through the police officer you know.
Never reveal your relationship with the police officer even to other policemen unless you are forced to.
Being informant is not an occupation; hence never introduce yourself as an Informant.

If a police officer is reckless in handling, call off your relationship with him and complain to his superiors.
Never give false information to police to take revenge on those with whom you have differences.
Never try to cheat police when you meet them. Always remember, Police are trained to test information which they develop.
Never abuse your relationship with the police and indulge in crime yourself for a gain.
If you come across someone who has successfully informed aboutsome crime to the police in your friends circle or your locality,just ignore him. Do not unnecessarily talk about it. Be proud of him.
It s always exciting to get publicly acknowledged, but strictly avoid publicity to the brave act you have done.

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.
Never boast about your relationship with the police publicly or privately and never promise others that you will get their work done through the police officer you know.
Never reveal your relationship with the police officer even to other policemen unless you are forced to.
Being informant is not an occupation; hence never introduce yourself as an Informant.
Never talk to policemen publicly about your information.
Never reveal your Code name and your actions even to your close relatives and friends.
If a police officer is reckless in handling, call off your relationship with him and complain to his superiors.
Never give false information to police to take revenge on those with whom you have differences.
Never try to cheat police when you meet them. Always remember, Police are trained to test information which they develop.
Never abuse your relationship with the police and indulge in crime yourself for a gain.
If you come across someone who has successfully informed aboutsome crime to the police in your friends circle or your locality,just ignore him. Do not unnecessarily talk about it. Be proud of him.
It s always exciting to get publicly acknowledged, but strictly avoid publicity to the brave act you have done.

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.
Never boast about your relationship with the police publicly or privately and never promise others that you will get their work done through the police officer you know.
Never reveal your relationship with the police officer even to other policemen unless you are forced to.
Being informant is not an occupation; hence never introduce yourself as an Informant.
Never talk to policemen publicly about your information.
Never reveal your Code name and your actions even to your close relatives and friends.
If a police officer is reckless in handling, call off your relationship with him and complain to his superiors.
Never give false information to police to take revenge on those with whom you have differences.
Never try to cheat police when you meet them. Always remember, Police are trained to test information which they develop.
Never abuse your relationship with the police and indulge in crime yourself for a gain.
If you come across someone who has successfully informed aboutsome crime to the police in your friends circle or your locality,just ignore him. Do not unnecessarily talk about it. Be proud of him.
It s always exciting to get publicly acknowledged, but strictly avoid publicity to the brave act you have done.
Never show off with your reward. That might expose you.

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.
Never boast about your relationship with the police publicly or privately and never promise others that you will get their work done through the police officer you know.
Never reveal your relationship with the police officer even to other policemen unless you are forced to.
Being informant is not an occupation; hence never introduce yourself as an Informant.
Never talk to policemen publicly about your information.
Never reveal your Code name and your actions even to your close relatives and friends.
If a police officer is reckless in handling, call off your relationship with him and complain to his superiors.
Never give false information to police to take revenge on those with whom you have differences.
Never try to cheat police when you meet them. Always remember, Police are trained to test information which they develop.
Never abuse your relationship with the police and indulge in crime yourself for a gain.
If you come across someone who has successfully informed aboutsome crime to the police in your friends circle or your locality,just ignore him. Do not unnecessarily talk about it. Be proud of him.
It s always exciting to get publicly acknowledged, but strictly avoid publicity to the brave act you have done.
Never show off with your reward. That might expose you.

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.
Never boast about your relationship with the police publicly or privately and never promise others that you will get their work done through the police officer you know.
Never reveal your relationship with the police officer even to other policemen unless you are forced to.
Being informant is not an occupation; hence never introduce yourself as an Informant.
Never talk to policemen publicly about your information.
Never reveal your Code name and your actions even to your close relatives and friends.
If a police officer is reckless in handling, call off your relationship with him and complain to his superiors.
Never give false information to police to take revenge on those with whom you have differences.
Never try to cheat police when you meet them. Always remember, Police are trained to test information which they develop.
Never abuse your relationship with the police and indulge in crime yourself for a gain.
If you come across someone who has successfully informed aboutsome crime to the police in your friends circle or your locality,just ignore him. Do not unnecessarily talk about it. Be proud of him.
It s always exciting to get publicly acknowledged, but strictly avoid publicity to the brave act you have done.
Never show off with your reward. That might expose you.

As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.
Never boast about your relationship with the police publicly or privately and never promise others that you will get their work done through the police officer you know.
Never reveal your relationship with the police officer even to other policemen unless you are forced to.
Being informant is not an occupation; hence never introduce yourself as an Informant.
Never talk to policemen publicly about your information.
Never reveal your Code name and your actions even to your close relatives and friends.
If a police officer is reckless in handling, call off your relationship with him and complain to his superiors.
Never give false information to police to take revenge on those with whom you have differences.
Never try to cheat police when you meet them. Always remember, Police are trained to test information which they develop.
Never abuse your relationship with the police and indulge in crime yourself for a gain.
If you come across someone who has successfully informed aboutsome crime to the police in your friends circle or your locality,just ignore him. Do not unnecessarily talk about it. Be proud of him.
It s always exciting to get publicly acknowledged, but strictly avoid publicity to the brave act you have done.
Never show off with your reward. That might expose you.

How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.
Never boast about your relationship with the police publicly or privately and never promise others that you will get their work done through the police officer you know.
Never reveal your relationship with the police officer even to other policemen unless you are forced to.
Being informant is not an occupation; hence never introduce yourself as an Informant.
Never talk to policemen publicly about your information.
Never reveal your Code name and your actions even to your close relatives and friends.
If a police officer is reckless in handling, call off your relationship with him and complain to his superiors.
Never give false information to police to take revenge on those with whom you have differences.
Never try to cheat police when you meet them. Always remember, Police are trained to test information which they develop.
Never abuse your relationship with the police and indulge in crime yourself for a gain.
If you come across someone who has successfully informed aboutsome crime to the police in your friends circle or your locality,just ignore him. Do not unnecessarily talk about it. Be proud of him.
It s always exciting to get publicly acknowledged, but strictly avoid publicity to the brave act you have done.
Never show off with your reward. That might expose you.

BE A CRIME BUSTER
DO AND DONT'S
You might be coming across a lot of activity what you consider as a crime in your locality.
As a dutiful Indian you can’t tolerate this anymore.
You decide to inform police but you do not know how and to whom.
Here we teach you how to become a Crime Buster Yourself
Information is vital for the success of any police operation against the criminals. We consider passing information to the police is one of the most sacred duties of a citizen.

Adulteration of foods, medicines, seeds, fertilizers and fuels, scams in weights and measures etc.
Major financial frauds like bank frauds, chit fund frauds, multilevel marketing or money circulation schemes, tax evasion etc

Terrorist activity like collection of explosives, doubtful tenants, suspicious persons etc
Counterfeit (fake) Currency

Any Complaints ? Please Contact

Taskforce
How to inform?
As emphasized earlier, information is vital to control crime in the city. But it is equally important that the citizens take all precautions while passing such vital information. Let’s examine those precautions now
DO's
Dont's
Try to gather as much information as possible without getting exposed. You can use a lot of covers to accomplish this like their member, customer, marketing executives etc depending on the situation.
Generally police require information about the identity of the suspect, his habits, contact numbers, associates, hideouts, vehicles, movements, weaknesses etc
Always have a cover story ready for your actions
Identify the policemen in your locality who are capable of handling such information. Make some clandestine enquiries. Search for those who are efficient, composed, do not boast, ask you to meet him in his office
Call such policeman and give him some information about a sample case without revealing your identity and watch how he/she responds. If there is no proper response meet his higher ups secretly under some cover and brief them
Once you get confidence then try to meet him at a safe place alone where your identity is not exposed and also request the police officer(s) to turn up without getting exposed after taking all precautions.
Always use a Code name/ pseudo name when you talk to Police officer.
Use public telephone booths till you get full confidence on the policemen who are handling the information.
Try to memorize the numbers of the police officers instead of having them in contacts list of your cell phone.
Program your cell phone in such a way that when you call your number is not displayed in the recipient’s phone.
Always delete details in call register/log after you called the policemen.
You can also create an email ID exclusively for this and give information from a cyber café without revealing your identity.
Always use a trustworthy back up in case of your absence
Spell out clearly what you expect out of passing this information to the police
If you do not get the suitable reward you have a right to complain to his superior officers about this
Secrecy is the most important aspect in informing police
Never brag (indulge in loose talk) about your information to police.
Always avoid talking about police when you are in a drinks party. You might slip out vital info that might put you in risk.
Never befriend with someone who might wittingly or unwittingly expose your dutiful act.
Never boast about your relationship with the police publicly or privately and never promise others that you will get their work done through the police officer you know.
Never reveal your relationship with the police officer even to other policemen unless you are forced to.
Being informant is not an occupation; hence never introduce yourself as an Informant.
Never talk to policemen publicly about your information.
Never reveal your Code name and your actions even to your close relatives and friends.
If a police officer is reckless in handling, call off your relationship with him and complain to his superiors.
Never give false information to police to take revenge on those with whom you have differences.
Never try to cheat police when you meet them. Always remember, Police are trained to test information which they develop.
Never abuse your relationship with the police and indulge in crime yourself for a gain.
If you come across someone who has successfully informed aboutsome crime to the police in your friends circle or your locality,just ignore him. Do not unnecessarily talk about it. Be proud of him.
It s always exciting to get publicly acknowledged, but strictly avoid publicity to the brave act you have done.
Never show off with your reward. That might expose you.
