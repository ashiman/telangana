Prior to Indian Independence thought of work for developmental purpose to establish Revenue Department to Collector Revenue come in to the  minds of British Authorities  in the year 1803. Accordingly enacted the Board Revenue Regulation Act,1803, Bombay Land Revenue code 1879 and Revenue Commission Act 1894. Consequently, After Independence Board of Revenue constituted after abolition of  subedari  system and came into force from August 1st 1949; Consisting of 3 members and duties declared to be the General Superintendence of the Revenues from whatever source they may arise, and the recommendation  of such propositions to the State Govt., as in their judgement  may be calculated to argument or improve those  revenues and AP(Telangana Area Board of Revenue Regulation Act-1358 Fasli also enacted.
