Instructions to provide Enrollment ID in the EHS-form.
Please check the 14 digit "Enrollment No." on the left hand side of the Acknowledgement copy obtained upon Aadhar registration. Fill in this 14 digit Number in the EHF e-form under identification details. Eg: Enrollment No. 1111/15210/02106. Fill in this 14 digit number in the EHF e-form under "identification details" as 11111521002106.

Convert this into a continuous number by writing "Dated" from right to left without slashes and time without colons as in the below example: Eg: Date: 11/08/2011 16:48:44 should be converted as 20110811164844.
Please provide the number so obtained, in continuation to the 14 digit Enrollment No. The 28 digit Enrollment ID is made up of 14 digit Enrollment No. and Date & Time Stamp. Eg. 1111152100210620110811164844

Photo: Scan a 45 mm x 35 mm ICAO compliant passport size colour photograph of 200 Kb size.
Employee ID/Pensioner ID of spouse in case the spouse is a State Government Employee/ Service Pensioner.
DoB Certificate: Scan the Date of birth certificate of the dependent family member who is less than 5 years of age.
