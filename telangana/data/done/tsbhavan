Tourist Places In & Around New Delhi
New Delhi Tourism
Delhi Tourism, a government undertaking facilitating tourism since 1975 will take you to a guided tour of the Delhi through this website which explores the wonders of this city be it its heritage, the art and crafts, the diverse cuisine and culture.
A symbol of the country’s rich past and thriving present, Delhi is a city where ancient and modern blend seamlessly together. It is a place that not only touches your pulse but even fastens it to a frenetic speed. Home to millions of dreams, the city takes on unprecedented responsibilities of realizing dreams bringing people closer and inspiring their thoughts.
Even today, one can have a fascinating glimpse into the past in Old Delhi, with its labyrinth of narrow lanes, old havelis, and colourful bazaars. Rickshaws wind their way through this crowded, bustling capital of the Mughals, where life continues, much as it did hundreds of years ago. It is home to three World Heritage monuments—Qutub Minar, Red Fort and Humayun’s Tomb that have survived many centuries, and give an idea of architectural wonders created by emperors in the past. Central Delhi, with its tree-lined avenues, imposing structures and buildings such as the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Parliament House and India Gate, reflect Delhi’s colonial past. A number of museums provide a glimpse into the country’s fascinating history.
Other fascinating tourist spots are as follows:
Lotus Temple
Akshardham
Gurudwara Bangla Sahib
Jantar Mantar
Lodi Gardens
Chhatarpur Temple
Gandhi Smriti
National Zoological Park
Laxminarayan Temple
Teen Murti Bhavan

Uttar Pradesh Tourism
The history of Uttar Pradesh is very much associated with the broad history of India. It dates back to 4000 years. Formerly the area of Uttar Pradesh was occupied by the Aryans or the Dasas and their main occupation was agriculture. The Aryans, through conquests occupied the adjoining areas too.
They laid the foundations their civilisation in the region. It was during the Aryan inhabitation in the region that epics of Mahabharata, Ramayana, Brahmanas and Puranas were written.
The state is the heart of Mahabharata war. The Kosala Kingdom of Ayodhya is said to have been incarnated in the city of Mathura.

Harayana Tourism
The name Haryana has a distinct meaning – the Abode of God. In Sanskrit, Hari means God and ayana is home. And in this land of God, the guests are treated as Gods too.
The vibrant state of Haryana presents a vivid kaleidoscope of diverse landscapes, showcasing magnificent archaeology, and celebrating art and culture. A state that has transcended on a journey and preserved the best of both the worlds – the footprints of the bygone eras and a futuristic vision.
Haryana is unique in many ways. The land has been referred to as 'the heaven on the earth' in an ancient Sanskrit inscription. The Indus Valley and Vedic civilizations flourished here. Haryana has also witnessed several historical battles, including the battles at Panipat and has lent canvas for the epic battle of Mahabharata at Kurukshetra.

The city and fortress are built on a granite hill that is 120 meters (400 ft) high and is surrounded by massive crenelated ramparts. The fort was rebuilt and strengthened by Pratapa Rudra of Kakatiya dynasty. The fort was further strengthened by Musunuri Nayaks who overthrew the Tughlak army occupying Warangal. The fort was ceded by the Musunuri chief, Kapaya Nayaka to the Bahmanis as part of the treaty in 1364 AD. The fort became the capital of a major province in the Sultanate and after its collapse the capital of the Qutb Shahi kings. The fort finally fell into ruins after a siege and its fall to Mughal emperor Aurangazeb in 1687 AD. After the collapse of the Bahmani Sultanat, Golkonda rose to prominence as the seat of the Qutb Shahi dynasty around 1507. Over a period of 62 years the mud fort was expanded by the first three Qutb Shahi kings into a massive fort of granite, extending around 5 km in circumference.

Medak Church
The church was built under the stewardship of the Methodist Christian, the Reverend Charles Walker Posnett, who was driven by the motto My best for my Lord. Charles Posnett had arrived in Secunderabad in 1895, and after first ministering among British soldiers at Trimullghery, had launched into the villages and had reached Medak village in 1896. In those days there was no railway to Medak (the journey of 60 miles (97 km) from Hyderabad had to be done on horseback - and Posnett could do it in a day) and in the whole Medak area there were hardly two hundred Christians, who were using a small tiled house as their place of worship. As the number of Christians increased, Charles Posnett raised a moderate structure in the Mission Compound in the shape of a church, but thought it unworthy, and early in 1914 laid the foundations of the present cathedral church, on 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) of land in Ghusnabad area. When the people of Medak district were suffering from famine between 1919 and 1921, Charles Posnett helped them by employing them in the construction of the church instead of running a free kitchen. Construction went on for 10 years. Charles Posnett consecrated the church in 1924, thanking God for mitigating the sufferings of the people.​

Warangal Fort
Warangal Fort, in the present-day Indian state of Telangana, appears to have existed since at least the 13th century CE. Although precise dating of its construction and subsequent enhancements are uncertain, historians and archaeologists generally accept that an earlier brick-walled structure was replaced with stone by Ganapatideva, who died in 1262, and that his successors – Rudramadevi and Prataparudra – added to its height and added gateways, square bastions and additional circular earthern walls prior to the latter's death in 1323. This places the construction towards the end of the Kakatiya period. There were later modifications between the 15th and 17th centuries, comprising principally the addition of barbicans to the four gates in the stone wall and the creation of gates in the outer earthern wall. Remnants of the structure can be seen today near to the town of Warangal, which was the Kakatiya capital. The Archaeological Survey of India has listed the remains as a Monument of National Importance.

దేశ స్థాయిలో బాలికా విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు, బాలిక విద్యలోని వెనుకబాటుతనానికి కారణాలు తెలుసుకోవడం, వాటిని అధిగమించేందుకు తీసుకోవాల్సిన చర్యలపై ఈ సమావేశంలో చర్చించారు. బాలిక విద్యకు సరైన ప్రాధాన్యం లేకపోవడానికి వారి సామాజిక, ఆర్ధిక అంశాలు, లింగ వివక్ష వంటి ఎంతవరకు కారణాలో అధ్యయనం చేయాలని నిర్ణయించారు. ప్రస్తుతం దేశవ్యాప్తంగా పాఠశాలల్లో ప్రాథమిక, మాధ్యమిక, ఉన్నత స్థాయిలో బాలికల నమోదు, డ్రాపౌట్ ల శాతాలని అధ్యయనం చేయాలని తీర్మానించారు. ఎస్సీ, ఎస్టీ, మైనారిటీ వర్గాల వారిగా, పట్టణ, గ్రామీణ ప్రాంతాల్లో బాలికల నమోదును ఈ కమిటీ విశ్లేషించనుంది. ముఖ్యంగా విద్యాలయాల్లో, రెసిడెన్షియల్ స్కూళ్లు, హాస్టళ్లలో బాలికలకు ఉన్న భద్రత, మౌలిక సదుపాయాల కల్పన ద్వారా ఈ భద్రత పెంపు అంశాన్ని, బాలికల విద్యాలయాల్లో టాయిలెట్లు లేకపోవడం వల్ల వారి నమోదు శాతం తగ్గడం వంటి కీలక అంశాలు ఈ సమావేశంలో చర్చకు వచ్చాయి.
సమావేశంలో ఉపముఖ్యమంత్రి కడియం శ్రీహరి మాట్లాడుతూ అన్ని శాఖల అధికారులు చిత్తశుద్దితో సమిష్టిగా పనిచేసినప్పుడే పరిస్ధితి మెరుగుపడుతుందని అన్నారు, గిరిజన, గ్రామీణ ప్రాంతాల్లోని విద్యార్ధుల విద్యాభివృద్దిలో టీచర్ల దే ముఖ్య పాత్ర అయినందున వారికి మరింత శాస్త్రీయమైన శిక్షణను అందించాల్సిన అవసరం ఉందని అన్నారు. క‌స్తూర్భా పాఠ‌శాల‌ల్లో మౌళిక వ‌స‌తుల రూప క‌ల్ప‌న‌, కొత్త‌గా గురుకుల పాఠ‌శాల‌ల ఏర్పాటు, అన్ని వ‌ర్గాల వారీకి విద్య‌నందించేలా ప‌థ‌కాల రూప‌క‌ల్స‌న అంశాల‌ను ముఖ్య‌మంత్రి క‌డియం శ్రీహ‌రి క‌మిటీ ముందుంచారు.అదే విధంగా బాలికా విద్యను పెంపొందించటానికై తెలంగాణ ప్రభుత్వం తీసుకుంటున్న చర్యలను సమావేశంలో ఆయన వివరించారు. రాష్ట్ర ప్రభుత్వం కొత్తగా నిర్మిస్తున్న గురుకులాల్లో దాదాపు 500 గురుకులాలను బాలికల కోసమే కేటాయిస్తున్న విషయాన్ని అంతే కాకుండా రెసిడెన్షియల్ పాఠశాలలు, కళాశాలల సంఖ్యను గణనీయంగా పెంపొందిస్తూ దాదాపు 6 లక్షల మంది విద్యార్ధులను రెసిడెన్షియల్ విద్యా విధానంలోకి తీసుకురావడమే లక్ష్యంగా పని చేస్తున్న విధానాన్ని సభ్యులకు వివరించారు. అదే విధంగా తెలంగాణ రాష్ట్రంలోని ప్రతి ఒక్క ప్రాథమిక, మాధ్యమిక, ఉన్నత స్థాయి పాఠశాలల్లో కనీసం ఒక్క టాయిలెట్ అయినా తప్పనిసరిగా వినియోగ స్థితిలో ఉండేలా చూస్తున్నట్లు ఆయన వివరించారు.
దేశంలో బాలికల విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు ఏయే రాష్ట్రాలు, కేంద్ర పాలిత ప్రాంతాల్లో ఉత్తమ విధానాలు అమలు చేస్తున్నవారూ వాటన్నిటినీ స్టడీ చేసి దేశంలో బాలికల విద్య పెంపొందించేందుకు ఈ కమిటీ కేంద్ర ప్రభుత్వానికి తన ప్రతిపాదనలు సమర్పించనుంది. కమిటీ తదుపరి సమావేశం ఈ నెల 31వ తేదీన అస్సాం లోని గౌహతిలో జరగనుంది. ఆ సమావేశం అనంతరం ఢిల్లీలో దేశవ్యాప్తంగా బాలికా విద్య పెంపుకై కృషి చేస్తున్న స్వచ్చంద సంస్థలు అదే విధంగా స్త్రీ, శిశు సంక్షేమ, వైద్య, అల్ప సంఖ్యాక వర్గాల సంక్షేమ, గిరిజన సంక్షేమ, స్కిల్ డెవలప్‌మెంట్ శాఖలకు సంబంధించిన అధికారులతో సమావేశం నిర్వహించి బాలికల విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు తీసుకోవాల్సిన చర్యలపై సమగ్రంగా చర్చించనున్నారు.

బాలికల విద్యపై కేంద్ర ప్రభుత్వం రాష్ట్ర ఉప ముఖ్యమంత్రి, విద్యాశాఖ మంత్రి కడియం శ్రీహరి నేతృత్వంలొ నియమించిన సెంట్రల్ అడ్వయిజరీ బోర్డ్ ఆఫ్ ఎడ్యుకేషన్ సబ్ కమిటీ ఢిల్లీలో శనివారం నాడు తొలిసారిగా సమావేశమైంది. ఉప ముఖ్యమంత్రి కడియం శ్రీహరి చైర్మన్ గా జరిగిన ఈ సమావేశంలో దేశవ్యాప్తంగా బాలికల విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు అనుసరించాల్సిన వ్యూహంపై కమిటీ సభ్యులు చర్చించారు.
దేశ స్థాయిలో బాలికా విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు, బాలిక విద్యలోని వెనుకబాటుతనానికి కారణాలు తెలుసుకోవడం, వాటిని అధిగమించేందుకు తీసుకోవాల్సిన చర్యలపై ఈ సమావేశంలో చర్చించారు. బాలిక విద్యకు సరైన ప్రాధాన్యం లేకపోవడానికి వారి సామాజిక, ఆర్ధిక అంశాలు, లింగ వివక్ష వంటి ఎంతవరకు కారణాలో అధ్యయనం చేయాలని నిర్ణయించారు. ప్రస్తుతం దేశవ్యాప్తంగా పాఠశాలల్లో ప్రాథమిక, మాధ్యమిక, ఉన్నత స్థాయిలో బాలికల నమోదు, డ్రాపౌట్ ల శాతాలని అధ్యయనం చేయాలని తీర్మానించారు. ఎస్సీ, ఎస్టీ, మైనారిటీ వర్గాల వారిగా, పట్టణ, గ్రామీణ ప్రాంతాల్లో బాలికల నమోదును ఈ కమిటీ విశ్లేషించనుంది. ముఖ్యంగా విద్యాలయాల్లో, రెసిడెన్షియల్ స్కూళ్లు, హాస్టళ్లలో బాలికలకు ఉన్న భద్రత, మౌలిక సదుపాయాల కల్పన ద్వారా ఈ భద్రత పెంపు అంశాన్ని, బాలికల విద్యాలయాల్లో టాయిలెట్లు లేకపోవడం వల్ల వారి నమోదు శాతం తగ్గడం వంటి కీలక అంశాలు ఈ సమావేశంలో చర్చకు వచ్చాయి.
సమావేశంలో ఉపముఖ్యమంత్రి కడియం శ్రీహరి మాట్లాడుతూ అన్ని శాఖల అధికారులు చిత్తశుద్దితో సమిష్టిగా పనిచేసినప్పుడే పరిస్ధితి మెరుగుపడుతుందని అన్నారు, గిరిజన, గ్రామీణ ప్రాంతాల్లోని విద్యార్ధుల విద్యాభివృద్దిలో టీచర్ల దే ముఖ్య పాత్ర అయినందున వారికి మరింత శాస్త్రీయమైన శిక్షణను అందించాల్సిన అవసరం ఉందని అన్నారు. క‌స్తూర్భా పాఠ‌శాల‌ల్లో మౌళిక వ‌స‌తుల రూప క‌ల్ప‌న‌, కొత్త‌గా గురుకుల పాఠ‌శాల‌ల ఏర్పాటు, అన్ని వ‌ర్గాల వారీకి విద్య‌నందించేలా ప‌థ‌కాల రూప‌క‌ల్స‌న అంశాల‌ను ముఖ్య‌మంత్రి క‌డియం శ్రీహ‌రి క‌మిటీ ముందుంచారు.అదే విధంగా బాలికా విద్యను పెంపొందించటానికై తెలంగాణ ప్రభుత్వం తీసుకుంటున్న చర్యలను సమావేశంలో ఆయన వివరించారు. రాష్ట్ర ప్రభుత్వం కొత్తగా నిర్మిస్తున్న గురుకులాల్లో దాదాపు 500 గురుకులాలను బాలికల కోసమే కేటాయిస్తున్న విషయాన్ని అంతే కాకుండా రెసిడెన్షియల్ పాఠశాలలు, కళాశాలల సంఖ్యను గణనీయంగా పెంపొందిస్తూ దాదాపు 6 లక్షల మంది విద్యార్ధులను రెసిడెన్షియల్ విద్యా విధానంలోకి తీసుకురావడమే లక్ష్యంగా పని చేస్తున్న విధానాన్ని సభ్యులకు వివరించారు. అదే విధంగా తెలంగాణ రాష్ట్రంలోని ప్రతి ఒక్క ప్రాథమిక, మాధ్యమిక, ఉన్నత స్థాయి పాఠశాలల్లో కనీసం ఒక్క టాయిలెట్ అయినా తప్పనిసరిగా వినియోగ స్థితిలో ఉండేలా చూస్తున్నట్లు ఆయన వివరించారు.
దేశంలో బాలికల విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు ఏయే రాష్ట్రాలు, కేంద్ర పాలిత ప్రాంతాల్లో ఉత్తమ విధానాలు అమలు చేస్తున్నవారూ వాటన్నిటినీ స్టడీ చేసి దేశంలో బాలికల విద్య పెంపొందించేందుకు ఈ కమిటీ కేంద్ర ప్రభుత్వానికి తన ప్రతిపాదనలు సమర్పించనుంది. కమిటీ తదుపరి సమావేశం ఈ నెల 31వ తేదీన అస్సాం లోని గౌహతిలో జరగనుంది. ఆ సమావేశం అనంతరం ఢిల్లీలో దేశవ్యాప్తంగా బాలికా విద్య పెంపుకై కృషి చేస్తున్న స్వచ్చంద సంస్థలు అదే విధంగా స్త్రీ, శిశు సంక్షేమ, వైద్య, అల్ప సంఖ్యాక వర్గాల సంక్షేమ, గిరిజన సంక్షేమ, స్కిల్ డెవలప్‌మెంట్ శాఖలకు సంబంధించిన అధికారులతో సమావేశం నిర్వహించి బాలికల విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు తీసుకోవాల్సిన చర్యలపై సమగ్రంగా చర్చించనున్నారు.

New Delhi, 18th March.
బాలికల విద్యపై కేంద్ర ప్రభుత్వం రాష్ట్ర ఉప ముఖ్యమంత్రి, విద్యాశాఖ మంత్రి కడియం శ్రీహరి నేతృత్వంలొ నియమించిన సెంట్రల్ అడ్వయిజరీ బోర్డ్ ఆఫ్ ఎడ్యుకేషన్ సబ్ కమిటీ ఢిల్లీలో శనివారం నాడు తొలిసారిగా సమావేశమైంది. ఉప ముఖ్యమంత్రి కడియం శ్రీహరి చైర్మన్ గా జరిగిన ఈ సమావేశంలో దేశవ్యాప్తంగా బాలికల విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు అనుసరించాల్సిన వ్యూహంపై కమిటీ సభ్యులు చర్చించారు.
దేశ స్థాయిలో బాలికా విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు, బాలిక విద్యలోని వెనుకబాటుతనానికి కారణాలు తెలుసుకోవడం, వాటిని అధిగమించేందుకు తీసుకోవాల్సిన చర్యలపై ఈ సమావేశంలో చర్చించారు. బాలిక విద్యకు సరైన ప్రాధాన్యం లేకపోవడానికి వారి సామాజిక, ఆర్ధిక అంశాలు, లింగ వివక్ష వంటి ఎంతవరకు కారణాలో అధ్యయనం చేయాలని నిర్ణయించారు. ప్రస్తుతం దేశవ్యాప్తంగా పాఠశాలల్లో ప్రాథమిక, మాధ్యమిక, ఉన్నత స్థాయిలో బాలికల నమోదు, డ్రాపౌట్ ల శాతాలని అధ్యయనం చేయాలని తీర్మానించారు. ఎస్సీ, ఎస్టీ, మైనారిటీ వర్గాల వారిగా, పట్టణ, గ్రామీణ ప్రాంతాల్లో బాలికల నమోదును ఈ కమిటీ విశ్లేషించనుంది. ముఖ్యంగా విద్యాలయాల్లో, రెసిడెన్షియల్ స్కూళ్లు, హాస్టళ్లలో బాలికలకు ఉన్న భద్రత, మౌలిక సదుపాయాల కల్పన ద్వారా ఈ భద్రత పెంపు అంశాన్ని, బాలికల విద్యాలయాల్లో టాయిలెట్లు లేకపోవడం వల్ల వారి నమోదు శాతం తగ్గడం వంటి కీలక అంశాలు ఈ సమావేశంలో చర్చకు వచ్చాయి.
సమావేశంలో ఉపముఖ్యమంత్రి కడియం శ్రీహరి మాట్లాడుతూ అన్ని శాఖల అధికారులు చిత్తశుద్దితో సమిష్టిగా పనిచేసినప్పుడే పరిస్ధితి మెరుగుపడుతుందని అన్నారు, గిరిజన, గ్రామీణ ప్రాంతాల్లోని విద్యార్ధుల విద్యాభివృద్దిలో టీచర్ల దే ముఖ్య పాత్ర అయినందున వారికి మరింత శాస్త్రీయమైన శిక్షణను అందించాల్సిన అవసరం ఉందని అన్నారు. క‌స్తూర్భా పాఠ‌శాల‌ల్లో మౌళిక వ‌స‌తుల రూప క‌ల్ప‌న‌, కొత్త‌గా గురుకుల పాఠ‌శాల‌ల ఏర్పాటు, అన్ని వ‌ర్గాల వారీకి విద్య‌నందించేలా ప‌థ‌కాల రూప‌క‌ల్స‌న అంశాల‌ను ముఖ్య‌మంత్రి క‌డియం శ్రీహ‌రి క‌మిటీ ముందుంచారు.అదే విధంగా బాలికా విద్యను పెంపొందించటానికై తెలంగాణ ప్రభుత్వం తీసుకుంటున్న చర్యలను సమావేశంలో ఆయన వివరించారు. రాష్ట్ర ప్రభుత్వం కొత్తగా నిర్మిస్తున్న గురుకులాల్లో దాదాపు 500 గురుకులాలను బాలికల కోసమే కేటాయిస్తున్న విషయాన్ని అంతే కాకుండా రెసిడెన్షియల్ పాఠశాలలు, కళాశాలల సంఖ్యను గణనీయంగా పెంపొందిస్తూ దాదాపు 6 లక్షల మంది విద్యార్ధులను రెసిడెన్షియల్ విద్యా విధానంలోకి తీసుకురావడమే లక్ష్యంగా పని చేస్తున్న విధానాన్ని సభ్యులకు వివరించారు. అదే విధంగా తెలంగాణ రాష్ట్రంలోని ప్రతి ఒక్క ప్రాథమిక, మాధ్యమిక, ఉన్నత స్థాయి పాఠశాలల్లో కనీసం ఒక్క టాయిలెట్ అయినా తప్పనిసరిగా వినియోగ స్థితిలో ఉండేలా చూస్తున్నట్లు ఆయన వివరించారు.
దేశంలో బాలికల విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు ఏయే రాష్ట్రాలు, కేంద్ర పాలిత ప్రాంతాల్లో ఉత్తమ విధానాలు అమలు చేస్తున్నవారూ వాటన్నిటినీ స్టడీ చేసి దేశంలో బాలికల విద్య పెంపొందించేందుకు ఈ కమిటీ కేంద్ర ప్రభుత్వానికి తన ప్రతిపాదనలు సమర్పించనుంది. కమిటీ తదుపరి సమావేశం ఈ నెల 31వ తేదీన అస్సాం లోని గౌహతిలో జరగనుంది. ఆ సమావేశం అనంతరం ఢిల్లీలో దేశవ్యాప్తంగా బాలికా విద్య పెంపుకై కృషి చేస్తున్న స్వచ్చంద సంస్థలు అదే విధంగా స్త్రీ, శిశు సంక్షేమ, వైద్య, అల్ప సంఖ్యాక వర్గాల సంక్షేమ, గిరిజన సంక్షేమ, స్కిల్ డెవలప్‌మెంట్ శాఖలకు సంబంధించిన అధికారులతో సమావేశం నిర్వహించి బాలికల విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు తీసుకోవాల్సిన చర్యలపై సమగ్రంగా చర్చించనున్నారు.

Press Note
New Delhi, 18th March.
బాలికల విద్యపై కేంద్ర ప్రభుత్వం రాష్ట్ర ఉప ముఖ్యమంత్రి, విద్యాశాఖ మంత్రి కడియం శ్రీహరి నేతృత్వంలొ నియమించిన సెంట్రల్ అడ్వయిజరీ బోర్డ్ ఆఫ్ ఎడ్యుకేషన్ సబ్ కమిటీ ఢిల్లీలో శనివారం నాడు తొలిసారిగా సమావేశమైంది. ఉప ముఖ్యమంత్రి కడియం శ్రీహరి చైర్మన్ గా జరిగిన ఈ సమావేశంలో దేశవ్యాప్తంగా బాలికల విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు అనుసరించాల్సిన వ్యూహంపై కమిటీ సభ్యులు చర్చించారు.
దేశ స్థాయిలో బాలికా విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు, బాలిక విద్యలోని వెనుకబాటుతనానికి కారణాలు తెలుసుకోవడం, వాటిని అధిగమించేందుకు తీసుకోవాల్సిన చర్యలపై ఈ సమావేశంలో చర్చించారు. బాలిక విద్యకు సరైన ప్రాధాన్యం లేకపోవడానికి వారి సామాజిక, ఆర్ధిక అంశాలు, లింగ వివక్ష వంటి ఎంతవరకు కారణాలో అధ్యయనం చేయాలని నిర్ణయించారు. ప్రస్తుతం దేశవ్యాప్తంగా పాఠశాలల్లో ప్రాథమిక, మాధ్యమిక, ఉన్నత స్థాయిలో బాలికల నమోదు, డ్రాపౌట్ ల శాతాలని అధ్యయనం చేయాలని తీర్మానించారు. ఎస్సీ, ఎస్టీ, మైనారిటీ వర్గాల వారిగా, పట్టణ, గ్రామీణ ప్రాంతాల్లో బాలికల నమోదును ఈ కమిటీ విశ్లేషించనుంది. ముఖ్యంగా విద్యాలయాల్లో, రెసిడెన్షియల్ స్కూళ్లు, హాస్టళ్లలో బాలికలకు ఉన్న భద్రత, మౌలిక సదుపాయాల కల్పన ద్వారా ఈ భద్రత పెంపు అంశాన్ని, బాలికల విద్యాలయాల్లో టాయిలెట్లు లేకపోవడం వల్ల వారి నమోదు శాతం తగ్గడం వంటి కీలక అంశాలు ఈ సమావేశంలో చర్చకు వచ్చాయి.
సమావేశంలో ఉపముఖ్యమంత్రి కడియం శ్రీహరి మాట్లాడుతూ అన్ని శాఖల అధికారులు చిత్తశుద్దితో సమిష్టిగా పనిచేసినప్పుడే పరిస్ధితి మెరుగుపడుతుందని అన్నారు, గిరిజన, గ్రామీణ ప్రాంతాల్లోని విద్యార్ధుల విద్యాభివృద్దిలో టీచర్ల దే ముఖ్య పాత్ర అయినందున వారికి మరింత శాస్త్రీయమైన శిక్షణను అందించాల్సిన అవసరం ఉందని అన్నారు. క‌స్తూర్భా పాఠ‌శాల‌ల్లో మౌళిక వ‌స‌తుల రూప క‌ల్ప‌న‌, కొత్త‌గా గురుకుల పాఠ‌శాల‌ల ఏర్పాటు, అన్ని వ‌ర్గాల వారీకి విద్య‌నందించేలా ప‌థ‌కాల రూప‌క‌ల్స‌న అంశాల‌ను ముఖ్య‌మంత్రి క‌డియం శ్రీహ‌రి క‌మిటీ ముందుంచారు.అదే విధంగా బాలికా విద్యను పెంపొందించటానికై తెలంగాణ ప్రభుత్వం తీసుకుంటున్న చర్యలను సమావేశంలో ఆయన వివరించారు. రాష్ట్ర ప్రభుత్వం కొత్తగా నిర్మిస్తున్న గురుకులాల్లో దాదాపు 500 గురుకులాలను బాలికల కోసమే కేటాయిస్తున్న విషయాన్ని అంతే కాకుండా రెసిడెన్షియల్ పాఠశాలలు, కళాశాలల సంఖ్యను గణనీయంగా పెంపొందిస్తూ దాదాపు 6 లక్షల మంది విద్యార్ధులను రెసిడెన్షియల్ విద్యా విధానంలోకి తీసుకురావడమే లక్ష్యంగా పని చేస్తున్న విధానాన్ని సభ్యులకు వివరించారు. అదే విధంగా తెలంగాణ రాష్ట్రంలోని ప్రతి ఒక్క ప్రాథమిక, మాధ్యమిక, ఉన్నత స్థాయి పాఠశాలల్లో కనీసం ఒక్క టాయిలెట్ అయినా తప్పనిసరిగా వినియోగ స్థితిలో ఉండేలా చూస్తున్నట్లు ఆయన వివరించారు.
దేశంలో బాలికల విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు ఏయే రాష్ట్రాలు, కేంద్ర పాలిత ప్రాంతాల్లో ఉత్తమ విధానాలు అమలు చేస్తున్నవారూ వాటన్నిటినీ స్టడీ చేసి దేశంలో బాలికల విద్య పెంపొందించేందుకు ఈ కమిటీ కేంద్ర ప్రభుత్వానికి తన ప్రతిపాదనలు సమర్పించనుంది. కమిటీ తదుపరి సమావేశం ఈ నెల 31వ తేదీన అస్సాం లోని గౌహతిలో జరగనుంది. ఆ సమావేశం అనంతరం ఢిల్లీలో దేశవ్యాప్తంగా బాలికా విద్య పెంపుకై కృషి చేస్తున్న స్వచ్చంద సంస్థలు అదే విధంగా స్త్రీ, శిశు సంక్షేమ, వైద్య, అల్ప సంఖ్యాక వర్గాల సంక్షేమ, గిరిజన సంక్షేమ, స్కిల్ డెవలప్‌మెంట్ శాఖలకు సంబంధించిన అధికారులతో సమావేశం నిర్వహించి బాలికల విద్యను ప్రోత్సహించేందుకు తీసుకోవాల్సిన చర్యలపై సమగ్రంగా చర్చించనున్నారు.
