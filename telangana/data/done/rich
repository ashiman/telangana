LIFESCIENCES AND PHARMA
What is RICH
RICH is an initiative that has been conceived to unlock the national treasure created by the top scientific research institutions in Telangana State, and to actively facilitate the process of taking their research to market. This requires new ideas, innovations, technologies, advisors, mentors, funding and support services, to be brought together seamlessly. The Government recognizes that there are gaps in this innovation-entrepreneurship-investment ecosystem, which has prevented full utilization of the R&D work taking place in these institutions. RICH is the platform that will link research institutions, academia and industry along with venture capitalists, angel investors and incubators. RICH will initially focus on three sectors, same model of collaboration will later be extended to other priority sectors of the State.

Mr. ArunDakhole
Co-Founder & Director-Strategy - Lean Technocrats India Pvt. Ltd
When the idea of AC helmets hatched, I was a student in TEP at ISB. Mr. Rangnekar, being the dean of ISB during the course, was indirectly one of the earliest part of our start-up's journey, where TEP helped me refine my idea and develop a business around it.
Mr. KausthubKaundinya
CEO - Jarsh Innovations
ATGC started at IKP incubator and graduated. During start up to scale up phase of the company RICH was a gateway for connecting to global industry leaders and policy makers.

Managing Director –ATGC
RICH team is excellent and professional in dealing with an entrepreneur's requirement! Both the leadership and executive team is very personal, warm and empathetic towards the entrepreneur and the venture, aligning with the vision of their very existence.

Mr. SatyajeetMahapatra
CEO - eXabit Systems Pvt Ltd
Finding the right kind of partners is critical for a start up to succeed. RICH team was extremely helpful in connecting us to industries in their network.  We are signing a strategic partnership with Delta Agrigenetics, who will be taking our SNIPR technology based products to market.
Dr. Renuka Founder
CEO – BioPrimeAgrisolutions
Our journey of being incubated with RICH has been just a little under 5 months and it has been a quantum leap of progress from start-up idea to execution. So far we have finished ideating our products, connecting to suppliers, developing a business plan, developing manufacturing strategy and gotten into the smaller details as well, that most start-ups usually just gloss over. All these steps (and more) were finished in an incredible time period of 3 months, with room for product development iterations and feedback discussions with RICH
Mr. Raya
Founder - Natural Super Foods
Paddy/Rice has always been our area of interest. We do approach other research and academic agencies for any clarifications or product development. But I must acknowledge that the response quality/time after getting introduced to RICH has been enormously fast.
Mr.  HitenBhimani
Managing Director - Shree Gajanan Industries
RICH is an institutional innovation to foster interdisciplinary approach to problem solving. ICRISAT and particularly ihub (ICRISAT’s new ICT4Ag incubator) has had an enriching and deep engagement with RICH. RICH has complemented ihub’s efforts by enabling selected incubatees graduate to the next level. We hope that RICH and ihub will continue to complement one another and create more game changing innovations.

9 dollars. That’s as much profit as an average airline made on each passenger it flew in 2017. In a slightly different context, that’s a net margin of about 4.7% which is a little better than the benefits that the credit card company gave back to you on the sandwich you bought at the airport.

LIFESCIENCES AND PHARMA
What is RICH
RICH is an initiative that has been conceived to unlock the national treasure created by the top scientific research institutions in Telangana State, and to actively facilitate the process of taking their research to market. This requires new ideas, innovations, technologies, advisors, mentors, funding and support services, to be brought together seamlessly. The Government recognizes that there are gaps in this innovation-entrepreneurship-investment ecosystem, which has prevented full utilization of the R&D work taking place in these institutions. RICH is the platform that will link research institutions, academia and industry along with venture capitalists, angel investors and incubators. RICH will initially focus on three sectors, same model of collaboration will later be extended to other priority sectors of the State.

Recycling of Plastics : An Analysis
26 July 2018
Published by
Dr. Maneesh Kunte, RICH
Source : The Guardian
Introduction
Enough airtime and print real estate has been devoted to the impact of plastics on the environment and the health and so on and so forth. A lot of effort is going into figuring out the science behind developing better plastics and better processes to recycle or recommission different kind of plastics more effectively and efficiently.
While this is absolutely critical and irreplaceable, both these approaches target two ends of the value chain – the entry point of manufacturing plastic feedstock and the exit where there is plastic that is ready for recycling. However, there is a large amount of plastic that is already floating around (literally and figuratively) in the environment due to the non-viability of recycling this plastic owing to design related issues. There is a strong case to be made for bringing product designers into this conversation at the earliest and this article tries to answer some of the “why” questions behind this.
Scale of the problem
The current global production of plastic is about 300mn tonnes and only about 8-14% of this gets recycled depending on the application that it was used in, due to the unfavourable (direct) economics of recycling. Typical calculations of the cost of recycling fail to include the indirect costs such as the cost of environ-mental damage and the health costs due to the toxicity of certain commonly used plastics.
In somewhat more graphic terms, the plastics industry consumes about 6% of global oil production which is as much as the consumption of global aviation industry. At the current rate of usage, by 2050, this number is expected to go up to 20%. Similarly, the plastics industry is expected to consume 15% of the global Carbon budget (to keep global temperature rise below 2deg C) by 2050.
Of all the plastic produced, given the 8-14% recycling rate mentioned earlier, the amount that leaks out of the system and enters the oceans is likely to outweigh all the fish in the ocean by 2050. This would have cascading negative effects on the productivity of these ecosystems (land and water) and food availability. It is estimated that if we can exploit plastic recycling to its full potential, we could recover between 80-120bn USD in value every year but this would only happen if we rein in the costs. Redesigning everyday products to make them more recycling friendly would be a great place to start, bringing down the complexity and cost of recycling equipment and processes.
Costs of recycling
On the supply side, the costs are of two kinds. The first, and the harder problem to solve, is the cost of the process of recyclingitself (after the initial preparation of raw materials). The second, somewhat easier problem to solve, is the cost of preparing the raw plastics prior to processing. However, the catch here is that for the cost of raw material preparation to come down, the products that commonly use plastics need to be fundamentally redesigned keeping a few recycling-driven design criteria in mind.
On the demand side, the economics are driven by the premium that a user has to pay for recycled plastic over plastic produced from virgin feedstock due to the market forces of the fossil-fuel economy as well as the plastic monomer industry.
Thus, the technological interventions to improve the recycling uptake are also discussed from these two angles – reducing the cost of processing and reducing the cost of raw material preparation.
Types of recycling
Typical recycling processes can be classified into three types :
Mechanical recycling
Closed loop recycling
In this form of recycling, when the plastic is shredded, the polymer chains are not broken down. Also, the quality and the characteristics of the original polymer are not lost so the recycled plastic can go back into similar applications as the original plastic. The loss in value is the least in this form of recycling. Also, when pushed back into the same application after recycling as before, the num-ber of usable cycles goes up drastically making this the ideal scenario
Open loop recycling
In this form of recycling, the polymer chains are again not broken down but the quality of the plastic degrades. As a result, the recycled plastic is usable only in an application that makes fewer demands on the plastic used. Due to the loss in value at each stage, the number of times that the plastic can be recycled is limited and is ultimately rendered unviable to recycle.
Chemical recycling
Here, the plastic polymer is broken down into individual monomers or other building blocks that can be used as a chemical starting point in the manufacture of plastics. The quality of the monomers thus pro-duced are almost as good as that of virgin feedstock but the costs can be prohibitive.
Pyrolysis
Here, the focus is on energy recovery rather than material recovery as the plastic is reduced in the absence of oxygen to produce a crude oil of sorts.The end-product is a wax or a similar hydrocarbon that requires significant purification before usage.
In an Indian context, the economics also encourage direct burning of plastic as a fuel instead of coal.
Traditional Value chain
To be able to locate the problems leading to low recycling uptake, we look at the typical value chain of the plastics industry from production to end-of-life.
Of the input feedstock, about 90% is made up of virgin feedstock from fossil sources. About 9% comes from recycled sources and about 1-2% is from biological sources. These percentages vary based on the particular application sub-industry being studied, say, packaging, but the numbers remain broadly in the same ballpark for all sub-industries.
After processing and usage, about 14% is incinerated for energy recovery (as fuel), about 40% enters landfills and 32% leaks out of the system unaccounted for to litter the environment on land and in the oceans. Only about 14% is recycled. Of this about 2% goes into closed loop recycling that feeds back into the input feedstock, 8% goes into open loop recycling, while 4% ends up as the processing loss.
Generic challenges in recycling
Generic challenges in recycling that are applicable mostly independent of type of plastic, etc. can be segregated into supply-side (used plastics) and demand-side (recycled plastics) factors.
Supply-side factors
The supply-side factors are further divided into two types, the first type are the design-related factors and the second type are the use-case related factors
Design factors
Small format
Small plastic pieces such as labels, lids, etc. that are below 40-70mm in size can typically not be processed by industrial recycling equipment and end up leaking into the environment. These make up 10% of the non-recyclable plastics.
Solution :Redesigning containers, etc.
Impact : Recovery of 50-70USD/ton
Multi-material pieces
Components made of multiple materials fused together for functional or for aesthetic reasons cannot be easily recycled due to the formation of non-mixing phases which weaken the recycled material
Solution : Choosing appropriate mono-materials to replace the multi-material
Impact :25-40USD/ton
Thus, the net value that can be recovered by redesigning plastic parts while including recycling-based de-sign constraints can drop the cost of recycled feedstock by 95-140USD/ton from the original recycling cost of 170-250USD/ton.
Use-case factors
A significant percentage of packaging plastics end up being single-use plastics. Close to 32% of this ends up leaking into the environment. The most effective way of dealing with this has been to ban the use of single-use carry bags. The impact has been to reduce feedstock usage by about 2mn tons/ year and generate economic value of USD900bn/ year.
Demand-side factors
Recycled plastic feedstock has to compete unsuccessfully with virgin feedstock for various reasons as listed below :
1.	Global oil prices have dropped significantly over the last year driving down virgin plastic cost.
TechnologicalIntervention
Aligned with the previous discussion, the technological interventions can be classified into process-related technological interventions (including workarounds to get over design-related challenges) and logistics and supply-chain related interventions to improve takeup efficiency.
Process Technologyintervention
1.	Additive removal to improve purity of recycling raw material making certain recycling processes more effective and efficient as additives that would otherwise contaminate the raw material are removed.
Supply-chain / Logistics related interventions
1.	Developing standardised, modular, recyclable containers to improve reusability (for packaging in-dustry)
Other startups / companies working in the sector
1.	Agylix, USA :Converting expanded polystyrene into liquid molecules to be sold to refiner, or crude oil, if market forces allow it.

A case for tech in Civil Aviation
25 june 2018
Published by
Dr. Maneesh Kunte, RICH

9 dollars. That’s as much profit as an average airline made on each passenger it flew in 2017
1
2
Multiple ideas stand out then :
1. If you must start a business, start a credit card company rather than an airline. Or a sandwich company.
There’s another way to look at the problem. How would you use the financial statements of an aviation company to drive an R&D strategy?
A good place to start : Profit and Loss Statements
The revenue and costs for the civil aviation sector can be looked at separately since the drivers for each are largely distinct and yield different technical solutions as elaborated below.
Cost drivers
Lumpy capacity and Traffic Analytics
Source : The Weather Company
The most noteworthy aspect of the problem is the lumpiness of the airline’s capacity and costs, which is to say, the airline incurs costs at the aircraft level but it earns money at the passenger level. The only way to balance this equation is to ensure that the costs and revenues are on the same level, i.e., the plane runs at full capacity as far as possible. For you and me this means that cancellations and rescheduling of budget airline flights at non-peak hours are here to stay.
How does an airline go about deciding what times are peak hours, what kind of traffic is a certain sector likely to see, what are airport wait times likely to look like in these hours and how much additional fuel is it going to take to cover for this waiting time, what aircraft need to be deployed and which pilots have the necessary type ratings and may be assigned duties?
Analytics allows the airline to make sense of mountains of past data and pick the right schedule, assign the right aircraft and pilot, and carry the right amount of fuel to ensure the highest possible utilization of capacity at the lowest possible cost.
Source : Aviation Stack Exchange
20% of airlines’ costs are accounted for by fuel costs. When broken down into the simplest parts, the fuel costs can be traced back to the weight of the whole aircraft.
The maximum take-off weight of the typical single-aisle aircraft (Airbus A320 / Boeing 737) is around 75tons
3
The obvious question then, how does one bring this down? How much weight could the manufacturer save by shifting to lighter materials? Composites? Carbon-fiber? The problem is that lighter materials generally present themselves in the form of a double-edged sword. The ability of lighter new-age materials to replace conventional materials is a direct consequence of the increased hardness and strength of these materials. This makes them less machinable giving rise to new cost-drivers: what kind of process and tooling changes would be needed to machine these materials? Would this also require part design changes which would need re-certification?
Since the costs of the new machining equipment as well as the redesigns and recertifications would be borne by the OEM and amortized across all new planes manufactured, how would this affect the cost of acquisition for an airline. Secondly, since a large number of aircraft these days are procured on leases rather than outright purchases
4
Additive manufacturing
Source : EuroNews
No discussion on material technology and manufacturing is complete without touching upon additive manufacturing or 3-D printing. While 3-D printing has the potential to bring down total cost of ownership for small volume or niche jobs, especially prototyping, the impact on the civil aviation sector will need to be evaluated carefully.
This is because on a small run, additive manufacturing does away with a lot of the infrastructure requirement (specialized equipment). On an intermediate volume run, the costs are comparable but 3-D printing edges ahead as it simplifies the supply chain
5
In the longer run, however, when it comes to complete redesigns of components or the aircraft itself, the ability of 3-D printing to manufacture very complex shapes without running into issues of tool fouling and mold removal like in traditional manufacturing makes significant weight reduction at a component and assembly level possible. Also, as the capability of 3-D printers to work with metals improves, the utility of the technology can be expected to explode!
In general, though, 3-D printing is likely to make a much larger or atleast earlier mark in the Defence Aviation sector where volumes are much lower than civil aviation and manufacturer support is often low or unavailable due to various reasons including shifts in strategic concerns.
Ground costs and IoT
Source : Vienna International Airport
Source : GE Aviation
Ground costs are another form of lumpy variable costs that apply at the aircraft level. These include a host of charges starting from the usage of airspace, the apron and towing charges, the overnight parking charges, etc. The other way of looking at it is that since passengers pay for a trip and not for the time, the airline’s worry over economies of density is now twofold – people as well as time, i.e., the airline needs to cram in more people per flight and more flights per day. In other words, any aircraft not in the air is actually bleeding money.
The typical nature of ground costs is a step-function wherein the first chunk of time at the airport (typically the first two hours) is free, followed by a time-proportional charge
6
provider (and are hence less controllable), the airline is now able to have a stronger grip on the people and material flow on ground and is better able to predict how long the aircraft will be on ground.
Training costs and Augmented/ Virtual/ Mixed Reality
Source : NLR Netherlands Aerospace Centre
Augmented/ Virtual/ Mixed Reality (AR/ VR/ MR) hold some potential to drop training costs for MRO operations since physical equipment is no longer needed to train incoming engineers. However, this claim will need to be investigated carefully for the following reasons :
1. AR/ VR/ MR solutions which replace standard VR devices such as the HoloLens with regular tablets or other mobile phones for reasons of lower cost and greater comfort do not seem to add significantly greater value over, say, viewing a 3-D CAD model of the component on a computer. While the cost of a (additional) software license would be saved, this cost when spread over the thousands of engineers trained is no longer very significant.
Where AR/ VR/ MR solutions score in the current context is on two counts. In the training space, AR/ VR/ MR solutions address a serious shortage in skilled manpower by handholding MRO trainee engineers directly on the job by making instructions available in a visual fashion inline with or overlaid on the actual component being inspected. It also smoothens the workflow for the engineer by reducing the need to keep switching between the component and manual while on the job, improving efficiency by about 10-12%
In the long run, AR/ VR/ MR could disrupt the training and the MRO domains with the addition of two pieces of critical technology which are being researched at the time of writing this – haptic feedback and visual feedback, respectively. In the training area, if the integration of haptics allows engineers to get a feel (literally!) for the components that they are likely to work on, the benefits over traditional 3-D CAD models, etc. could be significant.
Similarly, in the MRO space, if the AR/MR solution is able to compare or overlay the actual component with an ideal component and is able to highlight the differences, the process of fault localization could be greatly speeded up leading to much larger benefits than just efficiency improvements.
Revenue drivers
Source : Fandom : The Star Wars Wikia
To the outsider building solutions for the airline industry, it is unfortunately quite common to incorrectly identify the revenue drivers because of directly carrying over insights from other industries which target the same segment of consumers.
For example, the buyer of a luxury sedan is also likely to travel by air more frequently than some others but that does not mean that the buyer perceives these two products / services identically. Air-fares over the last few decades have dropped continuously and air travel for the population at large (barring the charter flight and private plane users) has increasingly been commoditized. Thus, unlike the sedan which is often an emotional purchase with the buyer paying not only for the asset but also for what the asset represents, the aircraft ticket is in principle identical to buying a seat on a ride-sharing cab service and the purchase considerations are likely to be similar, with a focus on service levels, punctuality and reliability rather than brand value or luxury or creature comforts.
This brings us back to the question of traffic analytics and economies of density of space. True differentiation between competitors on typical short haul flights taken by business passengers that is monetizable is more likely to come from predictable on-time arrivals and departures with fewer cancellations, faster check-in and baggage retrieval, etc. rather than bigger boxes of salted peanuts, hotter meals or softer seat cushions.
Summary
The above discussion can be summarized as follows :
Conclusions
Historically, technology has been the most disruptive force in industry, starting from the industrial revolution (Industry 1.0) two hundred and fifty years ago
7
Responding to the ever-quickening rate of transformation brings us to one of the cornerstones of management strategy – specialization of functions within an organization. This necessitates the offloading of a large part of the research to universities while industries focus on implementation or execution and value maximization. This is reflected in the shrinking of integrated industrial research powerhouses such as AT&T-Bell Labs
8
9
10
The process of specialization of functions within organizations also creates the need for a network player or moderator such as the Research and Innovation Circle of Hyderabad (RICH), which specializes in addressing the information asymmetry between industry and academia, streamlining information transfer between the two, thereby building a sustainable ecosystem in which each party plays to its strengths instead of diversifying on behalf of the other, jointly serving to maximize value to the end-user, unbeknownst to her, as she buys her sandwich.
