I payed for water tap connection fee of 600 rupees on 8th march 2018 through SBI INTERNET BANKING, Reference number IGADBMFDA5. Amount was deducted from my account but it shows that payment was not successful so I paid once again on 15th march 2018 through SBI INTERNET BANKING  Reference number OTHPG548902 To CDMAWATER. I thought that the amount will be refund automatically so I waited till now. But it did not refunded. I verified in the bank also. They said that the payment was successful to the appropriate merchant account. So please verify and refund my amount. Thank you.

I am not get print and acknowledgement
I have paid property tax through  T Wallet and received sms message to my cellphone,but in c&dma property tax dues it is showing due. what shall i do
12
13
When there is a server problem the tax receipt has not been generated neither the amount has been refunded in the debited a/c and tax is showing due in online.
 Inspite of addressing the issue multiple times by email no response is there. Addressing the issues need to be top priority from your side because matter deals with the money. Hope credibity is not lost for people paying online because of this type of non response.

How the approval process, what is the next process, should I wait for the Inspector to come and visit premises or should I go and meet the Municipality Office. Please let me know.

Uploading of ownership documents consists of many pages of Registration Document.  We are only able to upload first page of the document.  It will be nice if there is option to upload the complete registration document.

Entered Aadhar Number and Pan card Number in application.
But it is not linked automatically for Assessment.                          if it is linked automatically it will be good.
we linked it manually through CDMA website.

An integrated portal based citizen help desk and grievance redressal mechanism is under development, wherein citizens can send their complaints/suggestions/grievances to the municipalities through post or phone or Fax/E-mail.
The Grievances shall be forwarded to the concerned Department/Section of the respective ULB depending on the nature of Grievance for further action. The corresponding sections staff will attend the complaints in given time period and send a reply back to the citizen helpdesk. The reply sent from the corresponding department/Section to the Integrated Citizen helpdesk will be sent to the complainant. The complainant who uses internet can also check the status of his grievance through the web. This proposed system provides periodical reports on status-wise complaint list, department-wise pending complaints, etc. to the higher authorities for monitoring the efficiency and progress of grievance redressal.

When there is a server problem the tax receipt has not been generated neither the amount has been refunded in the debited a/c and tax is showing due in online.
 Inspite of addressing the issue multiple times by email no response is there. Addressing the issues need to be top priority from your side because matter deals with the money. Hope credibity is not lost for people paying online because of this type of non response.

I payed for water tap connection fee of 600 rupees on 8th march 2018 through SBI INTERNET BANKING, Reference number IGADBMFDA5. Amount was deducted from my account but it shows that payment was not successful so I paid once again on 15th march 2018 through SBI INTERNET BANKING  Reference number OTHPG548902 To CDMAWATER. I thought that the amount will be refund automatically so I waited till now. But it did not refunded. I verified in the bank also. They said that the payment was successful to the appropriate merchant account. So please verify and refund my amount. Thank you.

                        are assessed for tax. Based on such assessments,
                        taxes are levied on the property owners. The information regarding all the new

The Revenue section of the ULB/Municipal body is responsible for administration
                        of property taxation for that respective ULB. Property tax is assessed for each property
