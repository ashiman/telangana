FP Shop Automation with ePOS Devices
Under FP Shop automation,ePoS devices were introduced in 45 FP shops in Hyderabad on a pilot basis during 2012-13. This restricted the possibility of anybody going to the fair price shop and drawing ration on production of card.Â Â Â Â Â The biometrics(finger prints of the members of the ration card) were  to be  captured at the time of drawal of ration  and once they were matched ration were delivered to them since the ePoS with Aadhaar based boimetry,other than the member of the family attempts to draw rations, the device won't accept the finger prints and reject delivery of stocks.
ePoS Implementation is not only providing ration to the genuine beneficiaries but also resulting in saving of essential commodities both in quantity and resultant subsidy to the Government.With ePoS, a minimum average saving of about 14% of rice and other essential commodities and the resultant subsidy of both the Govt. of India and the State Goverment could be achived.
The ePoS project in 45 FP Shops in Hyderabad becam de-functional and due to which it was again introduced in 18 FP shops of the above shops on pilot through TS Online.
The State has been implementing the NFSA,2013 from October,2015 onwards and under it implementation , the FP Shop Automation is also a condition required to be fulfilled , the Government has decided to roll out ePoS intitially in 1545 FP shops in GHMC area and to roll out in the entire state by March,2015.Accodingly,the selection of System integrator Agency for rolling out ePoS in 1545 FP shops in GHMC area has been completed.  Work order has been issued. Training to the FP shop ndealers also given and devices handed over to the dealers.  The ePoS implementation will be commenced shortly.

End-to-End Computerisation of Targeted Public Distribution System:
Under End to End Computerisation of Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), NIC has developed the required "ePDS" software under End to End Computerisation of TPDS which is an online software application that helps the Civil Supplies Department in allocating Essential commodities to FP shops, digitize the ration card data, seeding the rationcard databse with Aadhaar so as to eliminate bogus / dead migrated / duplicate cards / units or ineligible persons and also to carry out mutations received from the beneficiaries through Mee Seva.
In Telangana State all the 10 districts are under the cover of ePDS which has become the main source of information pertaining to Fair Pirce Shops, particulars of the Card holders, Aadhaar particulars and usefull in the generation of Dynamic Key register, Online allocation of essential commodities to the Districts by the commissioner of Civil Supplies, from the districts to the Mandals / circles by the DSOs and from there to the FP shops by the Tahsildars / ASOs. The remittances towards the cost of commodities by FP Shop dealers through Mee Seva / eSeva centres, generation of online release Orders for release of stocks to the FP Shop dealers has also being implemented under end to end computerisation.
Under Supply Chain Management, the movement of essential commodities from FCI godowns / buffer godowns to MLS points and from MLS points total doorstep of FP Shops is being done. The closing balances of Essential commodities are uploaded in the ePDS website which is also being closely monitored and basing on the CBs, the online allocation is being made.
The requests of cardholders through Mee Seva for different mutation services also are now done in ePDS. This is helping the chances of getting reflected in database immediately after approval by the concerned ASO / Tahsildar.
ePDS also has a provision for making available the reports in public domain such as Master Key Register, Dynamic Key Register, Card Postition details, FP Shop-wise Card position, allotment Particulars, Kerosene Oil DKR etc. which will bring more transparency. By implementing the ePDS, all the activities of the Deparmtment are decentralized and the card holders will have the provision to search their ration card application status and may approach the concerned ASO / Tahsildar's office to get the ration cards or get their grievances redressed. ePDs will enable the Department to ensure that the field level functionaries are more accountable with which the department could bring more transparency in Public Distribution System.
